The `SOT-23F` component package is a 3-pin SMD component package that is very similar to the [SOT-23](../sot-23-component-package/) package, except the leads are flat rather than gull-wing (presumably that's what the `F` stands for). A PCB footprint for the SOT-23 can usually be interchangeably used with a SOT-23F as the leads have the same pitch and spacing.

The `SOT-23F` package is used for the same components the `SOT-23` package is used for -- namely transistors, voltage references
