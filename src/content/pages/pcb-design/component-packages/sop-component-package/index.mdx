SOP (Small Outline Package) is a SMD component package. The `SOP` is the SMD equivalent of the `DIP` component package, and has the same pitch of 2.54mm (100mil).

## Synonyms

* 11-5H1S: Toshiba's package code for it's 2.54SOP4[^toshiba-2.54sop4].
* 2.54SOP4: Toshiba variant of the SOP-4[^toshiba-2.54sop4].
* DUB: TI SOP-8[^ti-iso1050-ds]

## Similar To

* SSOP (Shrink Small Outline Package): A smaller version of the SOP package.

## SOP-4

The `SOP-4` is an easy to solder, medium sized, 4-pin SMD package. Commonly used for small solid-state relays (Vishay makes quite a few of them). Related to `SOP-4L`, which is the same width, but longer.

## 2.54SOP4

The 2.54SOP4 is a SOP-4 variant from Toshiba[^toshiba-2.54sop4]. It has slightly different body dimensions from the SOP-4.

### Dimensions

The 2.54SOP4 body is 4.4mm wide (the edges with the leads) and 3.9mm long. It is 2.1mm high from PCB to top of package[^toshiba-2.54sop4].
