SMC is a 2-lead SMD component package. It is also commonly known as DO-214AB. It is the largest package in the family containing SMA, SMB, and SMC. It is used for diodes that require good heatsinking requirements and/or high-surge current capabilities. Used for general purpose, schottky, and TVS diodes.

The package is easy to solder. The soldering iron needs a bit of juice though (especially if connected to large planes on the PCB), as this package is designed for good heatsinking abilities.

## Dimensions And Recommended Land Pattern

The height of the SMC is 2.62mm above the surface of the PCB. The used PCB land area is 50.6mm^2. Pitch is 6.8mm from pad center to pad center.

## Thermal Resistance

* $T_{\theta JC} = 10-16°C/W$
* $T_{\theta JA} = 47-55°C/W$ (mounted on PCB with 8x8mm copper pad area)
* $T_{\theta JA} = 90°C/W$ (mounted on PCB with two 1.54x3.14mm copper pads)
