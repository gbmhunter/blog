The _SOD-123_ (Small-outline diode 123) component package is a family of medium sized, 2-lead SMD packages, commonly used for packaging diodes.

## Variants

SOD-123 has the following variants:

* SOD-123: De-facto. Gull-wing style leads.
* SOD-123EP: Pads extended further under package for better thermal performance.
* SOD-123F: Pads.
* SOD-123FL
* SOD-123W

The de-facto SOD-123 leads are gull-wing style (coming out the side of the package), whilst the SOD-123F variant has pads (on the underside of the package). It is the largest SOD package from the family including SOD-323, SOD-523, SOD-723 and SOD-923.

### Dimensions And Recommended Footprint

Note that the pins in the above diagram are labelled with the diode anode being pin 2, and the cathode being pin 1. This is not what I would consider to be intuitive numbering!

## SOD-123F

The SOD-123F component package has narrow, flat leads protruding from the base of the SMD package.

### Synonyms

* DO-219AA: Although I can't find any robust source linking the DO-219AA to the SOD-123F, the Diodes Inc. dimensions for the DO-219AA [here](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Package-Files/DO-219AA_RevA.pdf) are so similar to the SOD-123F [here](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Package-Files/SOD123F.pdf) that I think they are the same?
* PDMU: Rohm's name[^rohm-rb160m-90-schottky-barrier-diode-ds].
* M1F: Fagor Electronica.
* Mini2-F4-B: Panasonic's name[^panasonic-db2x20700l-schottky-barrier-diode-ds].
* SC-109D: JEITA name, according to Panasonic[^panasonic-db2x20700l-schottky-barrier-diode-ds].

### Dimensions

The SOD-123F is 3.5mm long (from lead end to lead end), 1.6mm wide and 1.1mm high (typical or average values).

### Recommended Land Pattern

Below is the recommended land pattern for the SOD-123F component package from Diodes Incorporated[^diodes-inc-sod-123f]:

<Image src={import('./_assets/component-package-sod-123f-recommended-land-pattern.png')} width="900px">Recommended land pattern for the SOD-123F component package.</Image>

The land area that the recommended footprint above takes up on the PCB is $4.4mm \times 2.1mm = 9.2mm^2$. The pitch is $2.8mm$ based of the centers of each landing pad.

## SOD-123EP

The SOD-123EP is a variant of the SOD-123 package with one of the pads being extended further underneath the package for improved power dissipation. This package is typically used for diodes, with the cathode connected to the larger pad[^onsemi-ss12fp-ds]. Known as CASE 425AC by On Semi[^onsemi-ss12fp-ds].

## SOD-123W

### Synonyms

* CFP3 (Nexperia)[^nexperia-pmeg60t20elr-ds]
* SOD-123W-2 (Mouser)[^mouser-diodes-sod-123w-2]

Dimensions[^nexperia-pmeg60t20elr-ds]:

* Length: 3.5mm
* Width: 1.7mm
* Height: 1.0mm 

The above dimensions are nominal and include the leads (i.e. outer dimensions). This package the same nominal outer dimensions as the SOD-123F and SOD-123EP variants.
