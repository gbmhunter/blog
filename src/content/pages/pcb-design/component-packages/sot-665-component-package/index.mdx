SOT-665 (Small-Outline Transistor 665) is a SMD component package with 5 leads. It is commonly used for TVS diodes manufacturer by NXP and STMicroelectronics.

## Synonyms

* SOT-665
* SOT-665-5: Used by Mouser[^mouser-tvs-diode-search]. Presumably the 5 is added to indicate the number of leads.

## Dimensions

Below are the dimensions for the SOT-665 component package from NXP[^nxp-sot-665]:

As per the above diagram, the SOT-665 body is 1.2mm wide and 1.6mm long. The total width including the leads is 1.6mm. The pitch is 0.5mm.

## Footprint

A recommended footprint (land pattern) for the `SOT-665` component package is shown below:

The footprint has a land area of $3.38mm^2$ (1.3x2.6mm), ignoring any clearance area given around the perimeter of the footprint (i.e. courtyard).

Here is another land pattern for the SOT-665, this time from NXP:
