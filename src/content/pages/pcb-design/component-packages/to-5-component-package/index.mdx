TO-5 (Transistor Outline 5) is a family of older-style through-hole metal can component packages. The most popular variant is the TO-5-3 (3 lead variant), but variants exists with 4, 6, 8 and 10 pins.

The body may have a transparent window (e.g. for phototransistors) or other feature on the top surface.

The diameter of the pin circumference can also vary. Diameters of 0.200" and 0.230" are common.

## TO-5-6

### Synonyms

* H06C: National Semiconductor

## TO-5-8

### Synonyms

* H08A: 0.230" diameter P.C. (pin circumference), National Semiconductor

## TO-5-10

### Synonyms

## Pin Numbering

The pin numbering is clockwise while looking at the package from the bottom.

## Pin Circumference

The diameter of the pin circumference can vary between TO-5 packages. For example, there is a 8-pin TO-5 package with a pin diameter of 0.200", and another with a diameter of 0.230".

## Sockets

Sockets exist which fit TO-92 packages.

## Similar To

* TO-46
* TO-205 (this almost supersedes the TO-5 package)
