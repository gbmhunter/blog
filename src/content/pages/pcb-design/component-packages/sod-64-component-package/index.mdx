SOD-64 (Small-outline Diode 64) is a older glass passivated hermetically sealed 2-lead through-hole component package used for diodes. It was somewhat popular in the late 1970s and 1980s.

## Dimensions

The SOD-64 package dimensions are shown in <IRef iref="fig-sod-64-package-dimensions-vishay" />.

Notice the "bulb" length is 4.2mm and the width is 4.3mm. The SOD-57 is a similar package to this but with a bulb width of 3.6mm.

The datasheet for the Vishay BYV28-50 diode shows the SOD-64 package dimensions, but specifies the max bulb length as 4.0mm rather than the 4.2mm shown in <IRef iref="fig-sod-64-package-dimensions-vishay" />.[^vishay-byv28-50-diode-ds]

## Similar To

* [SOD-57](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-57-component-package/): Another glass passivated package that looks very similar to the SOD-64. The main difference is the "bulb" length and width of the SOD-64 is 4.2mm and 4.3mm, while for the SOD-57 it is 4.0mm and 3.6mm.[^vishay-1n5059-diode-ds] [^vishay-byv28-50-diode-ds]
