SOIC is the name for a family of SMD component packages that have gull-wing leads on two sides of the package. SOIC is a very popular package and is commonly used to house integrated circuits (ICs).

<Aside type="caution">
There are are three different widths of SOIC packages, all which can be referred to as just SOIC by manufacturers in component datasheets! When designing a PCB, make sure to double-check the exact package width matches the PCB footprint/land pattern you've chosen.

1. Package body width of 3.80mm (0.150"). JEDEC standard, commonly used for SOIC packages with a small pin count (16 or less).
1. Package body width of 5.30mm (0.208"). EIAJ standard[^bib-dexpcb-soic], used for SOIC packages with higher pin counts (>16) or for isolated ICs (e.g. Maxim package `SOIC [W8]`[^bib-maxim-soic-w8]).
1. Package body width of 7.52mm (0.300"). JEDEC standard, commonly called SOIC Wide or `SOIC-W` (e.g. Maxim package `SOIC (W)` variant `W20+6`)[^bib-maxim-soicw-20-28].

More on these different width SOIC packages below.

## SOIC (JEDEC, 0.150" Package Body Width)

The JEDEC version of the `SOIC` (a.k.a `SOIC-xN` (SOIC narrow)) family of packages is governed by the JEDEC MS-012-AA standard. There are non-exposed (normally just referred to as SOIC-x or SOIC-xN) and exposed pad versions (which are normally indicated with an "E" in the package name[^bib-mps-mp2497-a-ds]). 

The dimensions for the `SOIC-8N` package are shown below:

The dimensions for the `SOIC-16N` component package are shown below:

<Image src={import('./_assets/soic-16-component-package-dimensions.jpg')} width="575px">The dimensions for the SOIC-16N component package.</Image>

Land area:

* SOIC-8: 29.4mm2

Thermal resistance:

* SOIC-8: 70.6K/W (pads only, no copper fill)
* SOIC-8: 55K/W (6cm2 of copper, ground pins attached internally to die)
* SOIC-8: 33.5K/W (1 square inch of copper surrounding package, connected to ground)

## SOIC (EIAJ, 0.208" Package Body Width)

Confusingly, the EIAJ standard defines a different body width of 5.3mm (0.208") for the `SOIC`` package, compared to the 3.8mm body width as defined in the JEDEC standard[^bib-dexpcb-soic]. Generally used for ICs with a larger number of pins (>16).

## SOIC-W (JEDEC, 0.300" Package Body Width)

The `SOIC-W` (SOIC wide) family of packages is governed by the JEDEC MS-013 and IEC 075E03 standards. NXP's `SOT-162-1` package is a SOIC-16W[^bib-nxp-sot162-1].

| Package Name | Land Area
|--------------|-----------------------------------
| SOIC-16W     | 136.3mm² (11.9x11.45mm)[^bib-nxp-sot162-1]
| SOIC-28W     | 186.4mm² (10.3x18.1mm)

## Pitch

Most `SOIC` packages have a pitch of 1.27mm (50mil) and usually have Gullwing leads. When used for regulators, sometimes the many ground pins are connected internally to the die attach flag, providing better heat sinking capabilities. SOIC packages use _leadframe_ technology.

The `SOIC` package `R-PDSO` defined by JEDEC has a non-standard pitch of 0.65mm (and the standard wide body width of 7.5mm).

## Pin Numbering

Pin numbering is the same as a `DIP` package, in that pin 1 is at the top left, and then pins are numbered sequentially down the left-hand side, then up the right hand-side.

## Polarity Marks

There are three ways of indicating the polarity on a `SOIC` package. The first two, a dot or a notch, indicate pin 1 or the top of the chip. The third way is not so obvious, and features a bevelled edge along the side that pin 1 is on (so for `SOIC-8`, the bevelled edge would be on the side with pins 1 to 4).

## Related Packages

The `WSON` package by SST is lower in height than a standard `SOIC` package, but is designed to use the same PCB footprint.

## Adapter PCBs

Adapter PCBs for the `SOIC` family of packages are widely available due to the popularity of the package.

SparkFun makes a `SOIC-8` to `DIP-8-300` adapter PCB.

## Standard Pinout For MOSFETs

The `SOIC-8` component package is commonly used for medium-power N and P-channel MOSFETs. Most of these MOSFETs have the exact same pinout (both N and P-Channels!), as shown in the below diagram.

<Aside type="note">
As far I'm aware, this is not specified in any standard, but is just an industry default. Also, this only applies to `SOIC-8` packages with 1 MOSFET inside them.

Examples that follow this pinout include the [ST STS25NH3LL (N-channel)](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/sts25nh3ll.pdf), the [International Rectifier IRF8721PbF-1 (N-channel)](http://www.irf.com/product-info/datasheets/data/irf8721pbf-1.pdf), and the [Vishay SI9407BDY-T1-GE3 (P-channel)](http://www.vishay.com/docs/69902/si9407bd.pdf).

## SOIC-4 (SO-4)

The `SO-4` package is quite unique from other `SO` packages. It typically has the same mechanical dimensions as a `SO-6` package, but has the two middle pins on either side removed. Typically the `SO-6` pin numbering is also kept, such that the remaining pins are numbered 1, 3, 4 and 6. Due to the large clearances between the pins and on the package, this `SO-4` package is used for optical isolators.

The `SO-4` package is different to the `SOIC-4` package, even though these two different names refer to the same package at higher pin counts.

ON Semiconductor uses the case code `751EP` for the `SOIC-4W` package[^bib-on-semiconductor-bridge-rectifier].

## Common Uses

* Linear regulators.
* Drivers/buffers.
* High-power MOSFETs (normally in a SOIC-8N, with one pin for the gate, and either 3 or 4 pins for the drain and source).

## Similar To

* [QFP](/pcb-design/component-packages/qfp-component-package/): Another SMD package used for ICs with gull-wing leads (QFP has leads on all four sides of the body).
* [SOJ](/pcb-design/component-packages/soj-component-package/): Similar body sizes to SOIC, but with J-type leads instead of gull-wing leads.
