## Overview

SPM32 (Smart Power Module 32) is a 23-lead SMD component package. It is proprietary to Fairchild Semiconductor and used for some of their motor driver ICs. Similar to a through-hole version called the Mini-DIP SPM. The package is designed to have a large flat top surface for heat sinking.
