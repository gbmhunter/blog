Chip carrier packages are a family of large SMD packages that hold ICs with leads on all four sides of the package. One of the most common variants is the PLCC package with J leads. As of 2024, chip carrier packages are not commonly used, and have been largely replaced by [QFP](/pcb-design/component-packages/qfp-component-package/), [QFN](/pcb-design/component-packages/qfn-component-package/) and [BGA](/pcb-design/component-packages/bga-component-package/) packages when it comes to housing ICs.

One area it still remains popular for is when you need a swappable IC (as it is easy to make sockets for), such as read-only memory (ROM).

## Variants

There are lots of variants in the chip carrier family, including:[^wikipedia-chip-carrier]

* BCC (Bump Chip Carrier)
* LCC (Leaded Chip Carrier)
* LCCC (Leaded Ceramic Chip Carrier)
* PLCC (Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier)

## PLCC

The plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC) package as shown in <IRef iref="fig-plcc-3d-render" /> is likely the most common variant of chip carrier package. They often have a square body, but can be rectangular. All the ones I have come across have a pitch of 1.27mm.

The JEDEC trade group started a task force in 1981 to standardise the PLCC package. The MO-047 standard was released in 1984 for square PLCC packages and the MO-052 standard was released in 1985 for rectangular packages.[^wikipedia-chip-carrier] You can purchase sockets for PLCC packages, both through-hole and SMD versions. A through-hole PLCC socket is shown in <IRef iref="fig-adam-tech-plcc-socket-plcc-52-at" />.

### Synonyms

* **FN**: Texas Instruments package code for the PLCC.[^texas-instruments-plcc-fn-package-info]

There are some weird versions of the PLCC, for example the Infineon Technologies IR2131JTRPBF gate driver IC shown in <IRef iref="fig-ir2131jtrpbf-plcc44-missing-leads" />. It is a PLCC44 package, but some of the leads are missing, and the leads tuck into little recesses in the bottom side of the package.

## Similar To

* [QFP](/pcb-design/component-packages/qfp-component-package/): QFP is another SMD package commonly used for ICs, but has gull-wing leads instead of J leads.
* [SOJ](/pcb-design/component-packages/soj-component-package/): SOJ is another SMD package that uses J leads, but only on 2 sides of the package.
