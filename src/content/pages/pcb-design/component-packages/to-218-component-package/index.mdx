The `TO-218` (Transistor Outline 218, JEDEC) component package is a small family of through-hole packages commonly used for BJTs and MOSFETs. The 3-lead variant is the most common, but mention of a 1-lead variant exists (I've not found any real components which use this package!).

Variants:

* TO-218-1 (1 lead variant, have not found any components in this package, only a reference to it's dimensions)
* TO-218-3 (3 lead variant, most common)

Similar To:

* [TO-220](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-220-component-package): A very popular through-hole package which looks similar to the TO-218.
* [TO-247](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-247-component-package): The TO-247 is considered the "upgrade" from this package.

## TO-218-3 (3 Lead Variant)

Synonyms:

* CASE 340D-02 (On Semi)[^bib-on-semi-package-change]
* SOT-93 (On Semi)[^bib-on-semi-sot-93]

Pitch: 5.45mm (0.215")[^bib-on-semi-package-change]

Package LxWxH: 15.20x4.90x20.35mm (max)[^bib-eesemi-to-218-package]

Common Uses:

* BJTs
* MOSFETs

The below figure shows the dimensions of the TO-218-3 component package:

When housing a BJT, the pinout is usually:

* 1: Base
* 2: Collector
* 3: Emitter
* 4 (Tab): Collector

## TO-218-1 (1 Lead Variant)

Fairchild Semiconductor has dimensions for a "single-lead" TO-218 package, as shown below. Curiously, I have not found any components that use this package.
