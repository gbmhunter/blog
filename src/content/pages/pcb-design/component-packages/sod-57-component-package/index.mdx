SOD-57 (Small-outline Diode 57) is a older glass passivated hermetically sealed 2-lead through-hole component package used for diodes. It was somewhat popular in the late 1970s and 1980s. The 1N5059, 1N5060, 1N5061, and 1N5062 diodes were packaged in this format.[^vishay-1n5059-diode-ds]

They typically have high reverse voltage ratings in the range of 100V to 1000V. For example, the Vishay 1N5060 has a $V_R = 400V$. Vishay uses the term "Sinterglass" to describe the these glass passivated diodes.

Notice the "bulb" width is 3.6mm. The SOD-64 is a similar package to this but with a bulb width of 4.3mm.

## Similar To

* [SOD-64](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-64-component-package/): Another glass passivated package that looks very similar to the SOD-57. The main difference is the "bulb" length and width of the SOD-57 is 4.0mm and 3.6mm, while for the SOD-64 it is 4.2mm and 4.3mm.[^vishay-1n5059-diode-ds] [^vishay-sod-64-package-dimensions]
