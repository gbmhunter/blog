SSOP (_Shrink Small Outline Package_) is a family of plastic, SMD IC component packages with gull-wing leads.[^madpcb-glossary-ssop] They can have both varying pitches and body widths.

Synonyms:

- DB: The Texas Instrument code for the SSOP-16 5.3x6.2mm body package.[^ti-sn74cbt3251-1-of-8-fet-multiplexer-and-demultiplexer-datasheet]
- DBQ: The Texas Instrument code for the SSOP-16 3.9x4.9 mm body package.[^ti-sn74cbt3251-1-of-8-fet-multiplexer-and-demultiplexer-datasheet]

Pitch:[^madpcb-glossary-ssop]

- 0.635mm (unusual pitch used by Texas Instruments for their SSOP-16 3.9x4.9 mm body package (DBQ))[^ti-sn74cbt3251-1-of-8-fet-multiplexer-and-demultiplexer-datasheet]
- 0.65mm (most common pitch)
- 0.80mm (rare)
- 1.27mm (rare)

The SSOP package can come in a few different body widths:

- 3.9 mm[^ti-sn74cbt3251-1-of-8-fet-multiplexer-and-demultiplexer-datasheet]
- 4.4 mm[^nisshinbo-njm062c-low-power-jfet-op-amp-datasheet]
- 5.3 mm[^ti-sn74cbt3251-1-of-8-fet-multiplexer-and-demultiplexer-datasheet]

Solderability: Reflow is most suitable. O.K. to solder by hand by an experienced user. Care must be taken to avoid solder bridges between the legs of the IC.

Common Uses:

- Logic ICs in the 74 series.

Similar To:

- [SOP](/pcb-design/component-packages/sop-component-package/): SOP has a larger pitch and is used for things such as optical isolators.
- [TSSOP](): TSSOP is usually thinner with a height of around 1.2 mm, compared to the approx. 2.0 mm height of the SSOP package.
