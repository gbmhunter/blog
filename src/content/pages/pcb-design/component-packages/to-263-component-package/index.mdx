title: TO-263 Component Package
type: page
---


The `TO-263` (Transistor Outline 263, JEDEC) is a large SMD component package. It can be considered the SMD version of the `TO-220AB` package. It is a 3, 5 or 7 leaded heavy-duty SMD package that allows for good heat-sinking due to a large pad on it's underside. It is used frequently for high power MOSFETs, LDOs and SMPS.

Synonyms:

* D2PAK (Double Decawatt package)
* DDPAK (Double Decawatt package)
* SMD-220 (named so because the TO-263 is the SMD equivalent of the TO-220).
* TO-263 (Transistor Outline 263, JEDEC)
* TO-263AB (TO-263-3S only)
* TO-279 (TO-263 THIN only, by Texas Instruments)

The height of all `TO-263` variants except `TO-263 THIN` is 4.57mm. `TO-263 THIN` is 2.00mm high.

For every variant with a different number of pins, there is also an `S` variant in where the middle lead is cut off.

Solderability: Easy to solder by hand, as long as you have a decent powered soldering iron for the central thermal pad. Easy to solder with infrared and reflow techniques.

## TO-263-3/TO-263-3S

The `TO-263-3` is the 3-pin variant of the `TO-263`. `TO-263-3S` is the same as `TO-263-3` except the middle lead is cut off.

Pitch: 2.54mm

The junction-to-ambient thermal resistance for the `TO-263-3` component package on both standard JEDEC 2-layer and 4-layer boards is shown below:

* $T_{JA} = 18.0^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (1 square inch of copper surrounding pads, connected to ground)
* $T_{JA} = 33.6^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (copper filling package land-area)
* $T_{JA} = 36.7^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (pads only, no copper fill)

## TO-263 THIN

`TO-263 THIN` is a variant of the `TO-263` component package by Texas Instruments. It shares a similar PCB footprint, but is significantly smaller in height (i.e. thinner).

It still has a similar exposed pad on it's underside (making it footprint compatible with the standard `TO-263` package).

The exact dimensions of the `TO-263 THIN` package are shown below:
