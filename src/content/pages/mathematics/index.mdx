## Mathematical Syntax

<p>Below is the mathematical typography that is used on this site.</p>

<p>A non-bold standard letter is used to denote a basic scalar:</p>

$$ c = 3e8 $$

<p>Bold font and an arrow is used to denote a vector:</p>

$$ \b{\vec{v}} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\end{bmatrix} $$

<p>Bold font and a hat is used to denote a unit vector:</p>

$$ \b{\hat{x}} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{bmatrix} $$

<p>A bold capital letter is used to denote a matrix or tensor:</p>

$$ \b{B} = \begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\4&5&6\\7&8&9\end{bmatrix} $$

<p>A bold lower-case letter is used to denote imaginary component(s) (in things such as complex numbers and quaternions).</p>

$$ c = a + b\mathbf{i} $$

$$ q = a + b\mathbf{i} + c\mathbf{j} + d\mathbf{k} $$

A bar is used to indicate a conjugate:

$$ \bar{x} $$

The "triangle equals" is used to denote "is defined by":

$$ F \triangleq ma $$

The Fourier Transform is denoted with $\mathcal{F}$.

Belongs to uses the `\in` symbol from Latex (e.g. $x$ belongs to the set of real numbers):

$$ x \in \mathbb{R} $$
