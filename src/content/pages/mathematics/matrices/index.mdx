<h2>Dot Product</h2>

<h3>Numpy</h3>

<p>The dot product of arrays of vectors can be calculated using Numpy with:</p>

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]])
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
np.sum(a*b, axis=1)
```

<h3>Projection</h3>

<p>The dot product can be used to calculate the projection of a vector onto an axis in 3D space.</p>
