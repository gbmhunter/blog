<WarningIsNotes />

The cross-product is a mathematical operation you can perform on two vectors in 3D space. The cross-product produces a vector which is orthogonal to both of the input vectors, which means it is also normal to the plane containing the two input vectors.

## Mathematical Symbol

The cross product of vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is written as:

$$
\vec{a} \times \vec{b}
$$

## Defining Equation

The cross product is defined by the formula:

$$
\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = ||\vec{a}|| ||\vec{b}|| \, sin (\theta) \, \vec{n}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br />
$\theta$ is the angle between the vectors<br />
$\vec{n}$ is the vector which is normal to both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$</p>

## Cross Product Properties

The cross product of two vector always produces a vector which:

* Is orthogonal to both input vectors (i.e. normal to the plane containing the input vectors).
* Has a direction which is determined by the right-hand rule.
* Has a magnitude which is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two input vectors.
