<WarningIsNotes />

A 2D coordinate $(x_1, y_1)$ can be easily rotated by $\theta$ around another point $(x_c, y_c)$ to give the new rotated point $(x_2, y_2)$ with the equation:

$$x_2 = (x_1 - x_c) cos(\theta) - (y_1 - y_c) sin(\theta) + x_c$$
$$y_2 = (x_1 - x_c) sin(\theta) + (y_1 - y_c) cos(\theta) + y_c$$

The angle $\theta$ is positive for a counter-clockwise rotation. You may notice that the coordinate is translated as if $(x_c, y_c)$ was the origin, the rotation transformation is applied, and then it is translated back into position.
