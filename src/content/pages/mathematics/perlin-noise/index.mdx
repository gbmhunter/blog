Ken Perlin invented the Perlin noise algorithm following CGI work on the movie Tron.

## Libraries

<a href="https://github.com/Reputeless/PerlinNoise">siv::PerlinNoise</a> is a good header-only Perlin noise library for C++.

The <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/noise/">Python library noise</a> has Perlin "improved" noise and Perlin simplex noise algorithms.
