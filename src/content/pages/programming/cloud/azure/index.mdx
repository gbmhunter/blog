## Resource Groups

A resource is a single service instance in Azure. A resource group is a logical grouping of resources. A ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template is a .json file that allows you to declaratively describe a set of resources.

The region of the resource group does not have to be the same as the region of the resource. Resource managers can be assigned resource manager locks (either Read-Only or Delete).

Resource groups can usually be moved between subscriptions.

IaaS -> Infrastructure as a Service. You look after the OS, libraries
PaaS -> Platform as a Service.

Normally charged for egress of data, but not ingress.

Supported operating systems: Windows Server, Windows Client, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux

## Resources

A _resource_ is a primary primitive in Azure. Almost every thing you create in Azure is a particular type of resource.

Resources can be assigned _Resource Tags_. Resource tags can be used to logically organise resources. They are useful for the monitoring and billing of resources.

## Storage Accounts

Storage account names have to be unique across all Azure storage accounts.

Storage explorer is a desktop application for browsing Azure storage accounts: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/storage-explorer/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/storage-explorer/)

Blobs are a key/value object store (similar to AWS S3). Control user permissions with blob access policies. Block blobs are about 30x cheaper per GB than file blobs.

## Load Balancers

### Azure Load Balancers

A traditional traffic manager that can balance traffic between VMs (or other Azure end points).

### Traffic Managers

A [traffic manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/traffic-manager/) is a smart DNS form of load balancer can can resolve a `CNAME` based on performance/geographic requirements.

## Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud service that offers multi-tenant access and identity control.

Pass-through authentication: 

Federation: Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust.

## Management Groups

No management groups exists by default. Management groups can be used to group together subscriptions. Management groups exist in a tree-like hierarchy. 

## Subscriptions

A subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that is linked to an account. An Azure account is either an identity in Azure AD or a directory within Azure AD.

## Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Built-in Roles:

* Owners
* Contributors
* Readers

What can be assigned to a role?

* Users
* Groups
* Service Principals

## Azure Policy

You can use _Azure Policy_ to create, assign and manage policies. Policies are created from policy definitions. You can also determine the compliance for any policies.

## File Sync

Azure supports both import and export file sync job.

For really large files, you can use the data boxes (physical storage devices that get sent to your location and then shipped back to Azure).

## Permissions

Permissions in Azure tie in heavily with the Azure Active Directory.

Delegated: Used by apps the run with a signed-in user present
Application: Used by apps that run without a signed-in user present

It is best practise to use delegated permissions wherever possible. Only use application permissions when the app is non-interactive or the app runs without requiring a user to login.

### Legacy Windows-based Authentication

Users can login using Windows credentials with either _Kerberos_ or _NTLM_.

## Azure Monitor

### Application Insights

Application insights can monitor request rates, response times, failure rates e.t.c. Exception stack traces from both the server and browser (client-side application code) are logged.

Application Insights can then provide it's data via an API or through Visual Studio (for debugging). It can also create visualizations in the Azure dashboard.

## Azure Search Service

The _Azure Search Service_ is a managed search service provided by Azure. It allows you to import/connect to the underlying data and then easily create indexes.

## Azure Functions

Azure Functions are a way to run small pieces of code, in which you are only billed for compute time when the code is running (i.e. serverless).

You can write the functions in a number of languages including:

* Python
* Javascript
* Java
* C#

Microsoft provides a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) that helps you write and deploy functions from your local machine. Microsoft Oryx is used to build the source code into a "runnable artifact".[^github-microsoft-oryx-repo]

As of May 2023, the v2 Python programming model became generally available for use.[^microsoft-azure-blog-v2-python-model-available]

By default all files inside the function app root directory are bundled up and uploaded to the Azure Function when you deploy. You can exclude files by adding them to the `.funcignore` file. For a Python based function app, the `.funcignore` file might look like this:

```text
.git*
.vscode
__azurite_db*__.json
__blobstorage__
__queuestorage__
local.settings.json
test
.venv
```

`local.settings.json` contains local environment variables under the `Values` property. As suggested by the filename, these settings only apply when the function is run on your local machine. To have the same environment variables when running in Azure, you will need to add the environment variables to the function app settings. This can be done via the Azure Portal GUI by clicking Settings -> Environment variables.

### Using Python for Azure Functions

You can configure a function that runs on a schedule by using the `@app.timer_trigger` decorator. The below example shows a function that runs every day at 00:00:00 (i.e. once a day at midnight).

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func

app = func.FunctionApp()

# Azure Functions uses the NCronTab library to interpret NCRONTAB expressions. An NCRONTAB expression is similar to a CRON expression except that it includes an additional sixth field at the beginning to use for time precision in seconds:
# {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}
# 0 0 0 * * * means every day at 00:00:00
@app.timer_trigger(schedule="0 0 0 * * *", arg_name="myTimer", run_on_startup=True, use_monitor=False) 
def timer_trigger(myTimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None:
    logging.info('Python timer trigger function executed.')
```

Logging calls in Azure Functions can be accessed via Azure Application Insights. You will need to enable Application Insights in the function app settings before it becomes available. Once enabled, logs can be accessed via Monitoring -> Logs -> traces.
