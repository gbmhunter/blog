Google Cloud (a.k.a. Google Cloud Platform, or GCP) is a cloud computing service provided by Google.

## Firebase

Firebase is a Google Cloud service that provides a set of cloud-based features to make it easier to develop and deploy web applications. It bundles together hosting, database, authentication, file storage and other common cloud services into a single product.

### Firestore

Firestore is the NoSQL database provided by Firebase. It is a scalable database that offers offline support for mobile and web applications by caching reads/writes locally[^google-firebase-firestore]. Data is stored in documents which are in turn grouped into collections. Firebase provides a web-based console for viewing and managing data in the Firestore.

### Firebase CLI

Firebase provides a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to deploy and manage your Firebase projects. It can be installed via npm with the command[^google-firebase-cli-reference]:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

This will make the `firebase` command globally available from your terminal.

To deploy the entire Firebase project, run the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

To deploy only the functions, run the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

You can (slightly) speed up deployments even more by only deploying a specific function, e.g.:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:functionName
```

### Logs

Logs can be viewed in the Google Cloud console, or using the following Firebase CLI command:

```bash
firebase functions:log
```
