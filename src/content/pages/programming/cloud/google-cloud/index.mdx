## Firebase

Firebase is a Google Cloud platform that provides a set of cloud services to make it easier to develop and deploy web applications. It bundles together hosting, database, authentication, file storage and other common cloud services.

To deploy the entire Firebase project, run the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

To deploy only the functions, run the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

You can (slightly) speed up deployments even more by only deploying a specific function, e.g.:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:functionName
```
