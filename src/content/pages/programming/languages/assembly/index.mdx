## Intel vs. AT&T Syntax

### Intel Syntax

Intel syntax is the standard in the Windows ecosystem. Intel syntax always puts the destination address before the source address.[^stackoverflow-limitations-of-intel-vs-att-syntax]

```asm
instr dest, source
mov eax, [ecx]
```

If you see square brackets `[]` and/or the words `WORD` or `PTR` in the assembly code, it's likely to be Intel syntax.

### AT&T Syntax

AT&T syntax is the standard in the Unix ecosystem. AT&T syntax always puts the source address before the destination address. It also requires a `%` in-front of every register access, and a `$` in-front of immediate operands.[^stackoverflow-limitations-of-intel-vs-att-syntax]

```asm
instr source, dest
movl (%ecx), %eax
```

If you see round brackets `()` and/or a `%` in-front of the operand, it's likely to be AT&T syntax. AT&T is the default syntax generated by GCC.[^stackoverflow-limitations-of-intel-vs-att-syntax]

This page will use Intel syntax unless otherwise specified.

## NASM

The NASM assembly language is a very popular language that works on the x86 and x86-64 architectures. It has similar syntax to Intel's x86/x86-64 assembly, but it designed to be more "user friendly".

### Compiling NASM Assembly

You can download the NASM compiler for Ubuntu and other Debian-like systems with:

```bash
$ sudo apt install nasm
```

To compile a NASM <code>.asm</code> file, first convert it to an object file with the nasm program:

```bash
$ nasm -f elf test.asm
```

OR for a 64-bit object file:

```bash
$ nasm -f elf64 test.asm
```
This will produce an object file called `myfile.o`.

<Aside type="note">
Not all assembly instructions are supported for both 32-bits and 64-bits.
</Aside>

You then have two options for linking:

1. Use the linker program `ld`.
2. Use `gcc`. This automatically links against the C standard library for you.

Using gcc:

32-bit object files:

```bash
$ gcc -m32 test.o -o test
```

For 64-bit object files:

```bash
$ gcc -m64 test.o -o test
```

### Hello World (using NASM)

This Hello, World example will be as bare-bones as possible, and will not even use the `printf()` function call (instead it will make a Linux system call directly).

First, we need a `.section text` to tell the compiler that this is our executable code.

```asm
.section text
```

We then need to define an entry point for our program:

```asm
    global _start
_start:
    ... more code here ...
```

Now, printing `Hello, world!` requires the use of a Linux system call to print the text to `stdout` (specifically, `sys_write`). We will use the Linux fastcall convention which allows us to put the input arguments into registers, rather than on the stack. The system call number is placed in `eax`, and the arguments in the successive registers `ebx`, `ecx`, e.t.c. The function number for `sys_write` is `4` (<a href="https://syscalls.kernelgrok.com/">see here</a>). We need to place the file we wish to write to in `ebx`, a pointer to the message (`char *`) in `ecx`, and the number of characters in `edx`.

```asm
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov edx, <msg size>
    mov ecx, <pointer to msg>
    mov ebx, 1
    mov eax, 4
```

Note that I have assigned the registers in reverse order (starting at edx and going to eax). This is not necessary (any order would work), however this practise stems from the sequence required making a system call by pushing to the stack instead, in where this order is important. I just kept the same practise for good readability.

So, now we need to place the message in memory somewhere, and also find out it's size, so we can fill in `<pointer to msg>` and `<msg size>`. We can create a data section just for this purpose:

```asm
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov edx, <msg size>
    mov ecx, <pointer to msg>
    mov ebx, 1  ; File descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov eax, 4  ; System call 4 is sys_write
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, world!' ; Creates a string of characters. Note: No null terminator.
    len equ $ - msg        ; Calculate the length of the string (note, this does not store anything in memory)
```

`db` is a NASM instruction which stands for define bytes. It defines a sequence of bytes in memory. `equ` just tells the compiler to calculate the length of the message and save it to `len` (called a symbol), which can then be used in the code (it does not save the value to memory, it is similar to `#define` in C).

Lets use the new `msg` variable in our code:

```asm
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov edx, len
    mov ecx, msg
    mov ebx, 1  ; File descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov eax, 4  ; System call 4 is sys_write
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, world!' ; Creates a string of characters. Note: No null terminator.
    len equ $ - msg        ; Calculate the length of the string (note, this does not store anything in memory)
```

Great, everything is setup for a system call! But how do we perform a system call? In Linux, a system call is made by triggering the `0x80` interrupt, so we will do just that:

```asm
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov edx, len
    mov ecx, msg
    mov ebx, 1  ; File descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov eax, 4  ; System call 4 is sys_write
    int 0x80
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, world!' ; Creates a string of characters. Note: No null terminator.
    len equ $ - msg        ; Calculate the length of the string (note, this does not store anything in memory)
```

Running the above code should print `Hello, world!` to stdout. But your program might then just seg fault. This is because we have not exited cleanly. To do this, we can make another sys call, this time to `sys_exit` (`0x01`).

```asm
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov edx, len ; len was calculated in .data section
    mov ecx, msg ; Pointer to array of chars in .data section
    mov ebx, 1   ; File descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov eax, 4   ; System call 4 is sys_write
    int 0x80     ; sys call
    mov ebx, 0   ; Return code of o.k.
    mov eax, 1   ; sys_exit function number
    int 0x80     ; sys call
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, world!' ; Creates a string of characters. Note: No null terminator.
    len equ $ - msg        ; Calculate the length of the string (note, this does not store anything in memory)
```

All done! Run this code online at [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tpcg.php?p=qjMuBp](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tpcg.php?p=qjMuBp).

### Hello World With printf()

Because we want to know use a standard library function, we are going to take a slightly different approach.

Create a `test.asm` file with the following contents:

```asm
extern printf   ; Make sure to link with gcc so that standard library is automatically linked against

SECTION .data
msg: db "Hello, world!",0xA,0x0     ; 0xA = new line, 0x0 = end of string

SECTION .text                       ; Code section

global main
main:               ; The program label for the entry point
    push ebp        ; Save stack base pointer
    mov ebp, esp    ; Move stack pointer onto stack base pointer
    push msg        ; Last thing on stack is printf formatting string
    call printf

    mov esp, ebp    ; Unwind stack
    pop ebp         ; Replace base pointer

    mov eax,0       ; Return error code of 0 (no error)
    ret             ; Return from main()
```

Now compile and run with the following commands:

```bash
$ nasm -f elf test.asm
$ gcc test.o -m32 -o test
$ ./test
Hello, world!
```

## x86 Assembly

### x86 Register Names

Knowing a little history about the x86 architecture helps to understand the naming of the registers. Initially it was 16-bits, and registers had names like `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `dx`, etc. Then it was upgraded to 32-bits. The existing register names were kept as is, but new 32-bit register names were added which are prefixed with `e`. For example, `eax` is the 32-bit accumulator register. `ax` is the 16-bit accumulator register, and uses the lower 2 bytes of `eax`. The same process happened again when it was later extended to 64-bits, with the addition of `r` prefixes (e.g. `rax`).

<IRef iref="tbl-x86-registers" /> lists the x86 registers.[^stackoverflow-assembly-registers-in64-bit-architecture]

<table data-iref="tbl-x86-registers">

</table>

In x86 language, a byte is 8-bits, a word is 16-bits, a double word is 32-bits, and a quad word is 64-bits. This terminology remains the same across 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit x86 architectures. All of the 8-bit registers listed in <IRef iref="tbl-x86-registers" /> access either the lower or higher 8-bits of the corresponding 16-bit register. For example, `ah` accesses the higher 8-bits of the `ax` register and `al` accesses the lower 8-bits.

#### rsp and rdb

`rsp` is the stack pointer register. The stack grows downwards, which means as it gets larger, the stack pointer register address gets smaller (i.e. closer to 0). `push` decrements `rsp` (and copies the operand onto the top of the stack) and `pop` copies the top of the stack into the operand and increments `rsp` (makes the stack smaller). It is also valid to manipulate `rsp` directly rather than using `push`/`pop`. For example, you can use `sub rsp, 8` to make the stack smaller by 8 bytes.

`rbp` is the base pointer register. It points to the base of the current stack frame. The callee is responsible for preserving the value of `rbp`. Thus at the start and end of many functions, you will see the following assembly:

```asm
myFunction():
    push rbp
    mov rbp, rsp
    ; Rest of function code...
    pop rbp
    ret
```

### x86 ABI

In x86-64, the first 6 function parameters are passed in registers. If there are more than 6, then the remaining parameters are passed on the stack. In x86-32, all function parameters are passed on the stack.

#### x86-64 Calling Conventions

There are two main calling conventions used for the x86-64 architecture:[^wikipedia-x86-calling-conventions]

1. [System V AMD64 ABI](https://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI)
2. [Windows x64 ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64_calling_conventions#Microsoft_x64_ABI)

### Basic x86-64 Assembly Function Example

Let's take a look at what a simple C function compiles to in x86-64 assembly. This assumes the compiler is following the [System V AMD64 ABI](https://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI) (e.g. Linux, macOS).

Let's start with the C function:

```c
int square(int num) {
    return num * num;
}
```

Compiling with `x86-64 gcc 14.2` on godbolt.org gives us the following assembly code:

```asm
square(int):
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
        imul    eax, eax
        pop     rbp
        ret
```

Note that:
* `edi` destination index.
* `esi` source index.
* `rsp` is the stack pointer. `push` decrements `rsp` and copies the operand onto the top of the stack. `pop` copies the top of the stack into the operand and increments `rsp`.
* `rdp` points to the base of the current stack frame.

1. `push rdp` saves the address of the previous stack frame base pointer (which is currently in `rbp`) onto the stack. This is preserving the callers base pointer so it can be restored just before the callee returns (i.e. `pop rbp`).
1. `mov rbp, rsp` saves `rsp` into `rbp` to create a new stack frame. Now, `rbp` serves as a stable reference point for accessing local variables and arguments within this function's stack frame.
1. `mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi` copies the value of `edi` (the first argument) into the memory location `[rbp-4]`. According to the System V AMD64 calling convention, the first integer/pointer argument passed to a function is placed in the rdi register. `edi` refers to the lower 32 bits of the `rdi` register. Since the function takes an int (32 bits), the value is in `edi`. At higher optimization levels this operation may not be needed.
1. `mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]` copies the value of `[rbp-4]` into `eax`.
1. `imul eax, eax` multiplies the value of `eax` by itself and stores the result back in `eax`. `eax` happens to be the register the caller expects the result to be stored in, so this does not need to be moved anywhere.
1. `pop rbp` restores the previous stack frame base pointer.
1. `ret` pops the return address off the stack and jumps to it. The return address would have been placed onto the stack by the caller when `call` was executed.
