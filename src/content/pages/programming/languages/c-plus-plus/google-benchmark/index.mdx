Google Benchmark is a open source C++ library for performance benchmarking snippets of C++/C code.

## Installation

You can easily add Google Benchmark as a dependency to your CMake C++ project by using `FetchContent` in your `CMakeLists.txt` file.

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release CACHE STRING "Build type")
include(FetchContent)
set(BENCHMARK_ENABLE_TESTING off)
FetchContent_Declare(googlebenchmark
                     GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/benchmark
                     GIT_TAG main)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googlebenchmark)
```

This will automatically download and build Google Benchmark and make it available to your project.

This sets the `BUILD_TYPE` to `Release` to prevent warnings that Google Benchmark emits when it is built in `Debug` mode. `set(BENCHMARK_ENABLE_TESTING off)` prevents Google Benchmark from running it's own unit tests (we can trust it works well!).

<Aside type="tip">
You may want to replace the `GIT_TAG main` with a specific hash to lock down the version of Google Benchmark you are using. `GIT_TAG main` will always pull whatever version the `main` branch is currently at.

## Preventing Optimizations

`benchmark::ClobberMemory()` can be used to force the compiler to flush pending writes to global memory. This acts as a read/write barrier. This is implemented with `std::atomic_signal_fence(std::memory_order_acq_rel);`.

## Saving Results to a File

To save Google Benchmark results to a file, you can pass in the `--benchmark_out` and `--benchmark_out_format` flags to the compiled executable. For example, so save the results to a file called `output.json`:

```bash
my_benchmark_program --benchmark_out=output.json --benchmark_out_format=json
```
