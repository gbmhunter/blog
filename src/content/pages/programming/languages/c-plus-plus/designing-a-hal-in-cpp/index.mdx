title: Designing a HAL in C++
type: page
---

Objectives:

* Must be easy to mock and run on Linux.
* Must be easy to support different hardware platforms.
* Must provide a nice developer experience.
* Must be easy to understand.

We will use a simple GPIO HAL driver as our example when we look at different ways to implement a HAL in C++.

## Swapping Out .cpp Files

This method can also be done just as easily in C.

## Inheritance and Virtual Methods

Inheritance and virtual methods allow us to implement runtime polymorphism.

1. Define a base class which will act as your interface. Name it something like `GpioBase`. Define virtual methods for the interface, such as `void set(uint8_t value)` and `uint8_t get()`.
1. The generic parts of your app will get passes a pointer to a `GpioBase` object.
1. Create derived classes which implement the interface for specific platforms, e.g. `GpioReal` and `GpioFake`.
1. Create the appropriate derived classes for the platforms you are targeting in `main()`.
1. Pass these into the generic part of your app, as a `GpioBase*`.

Although implementing inheritance and virtual methods is more suited to a OO-first language such as C++, it is still possible to do in C. If you want to seen an example on how to do this in C, see the [Object-Orientated C page](/programming/languages/c/object-orientated-c/).

Let's start by defining a base class:

```c++ title="GpioBase.hpp"
class GpioBase {
public:
    virtual void set(uint8_t value) = 0;
};
```

<Aside type="note">
Common `#include`s and other boilerplate code are omitted from these examples for brevity.
</Aside>

Let's now create a derived class for a real GPIO pin:

```c++ title="GpioReal.hpp"
#include "GpioBase.hpp"

class GpioReal : public GpioBase {
public:
    void set(uint8_t value) override {
        printf("%s() called with value: %d\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, value);
    }
};
```

And a similarly derived class for a fake LED:

```c++ title="GpioFake.hpp"
#include "GpioBase.hpp"

class GpioFake : public GpioBase {
public:
    void set(uint8_t value) override {
        printf("%s() called with value: %d\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, value);
    }
};
```

We can demonstrate this with the following `main()` function below:

```c++ title="main.cpp"
#include "App.hpp"
#include "GpioFake.hpp"
#include "GpioReal.hpp"

int main() {
    // If we were in the real main()
    {
        GpioReal realGpio;
        App app(realGpio);
        app.run();
    }

    // If we were in the test main()
    {
        GpioFake fakeGpio;
        App app(fakeGpio);
        app.run();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This gives us the following output:

```
virtual void GpioReal::set(uint8_t)() called with value: 1
virtual void GpioFake::set(uint8_t)() called with value: 1
```

For any real world largish project, passing many GPIO objects (and all the other HAL objects, such as ADCs, DACs, Timers, etc.) into the App as individual parameters is going to be cumbersome. Instead, we could create a `Hal` object that wraps all these, and pass a single `Hal` object into the App.

```c++ title="Hal.hpp"
class Hal {
public:
    GpioBase* gpio1;
    GpioBase* gpio2;
    GpioBase* gpio3;
    GpioBase* gpio4;
    GpioBase* gpio5;

    Hal() : gpio1(nullptr), gpio2(nullptr), gpio3(nullptr), gpio4(nullptr), gpio5(nullptr) {}
};
```

Then in `main()`, we can create a `Hal` object, and pass it into the App:

```c++ title="virtual-methods/main.cpp"

```

## Static Polymorphism via Templates

One of the downsides to runtime polymorphism is that it can add additional CPU overhead. This is because of two reasons:

1. The compiler needs to look up the correct virtual method to call at runtime, which it does using a `vtable`. The cost of this is essentially one level of indirection.
1. Because of this indirection, the compiler cannot optimize the call to the method. This may be a more serious problem than the single level of indirection, as the compiler cannot inline the call or do other optimizations.

Static polymorphism aims to implement the lookup at compile time, rather than at runtime. It is sometimes called _early binding_.[^medium-using-crtp-and-cpp20-concepts-for-static-polymorphism] One way to do this is with templates and the CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern).

Let's start by defining a base class:

```c++ title="templates/GpioBase.hpp"
template <typename T>
class GpioBase {
public:
    void set(uint8_t value) {
        // This is where the magic happens
        // NOTE Intellisense will not be able to give you any help on what properties the class T has,
        // this is one of the disadvantages of template polymorphism.
        static_cast<T*>(this)->set(value);
    }
};
```

Let's now create a derived class for a real GPIO:

```c++ title="templates/GpioReal.hpp"
#pragma once

#include <cstdio>

#include "GpioBase.hpp"

namespace templates {

// We inherit from ourselves (sort of!). This is called CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern).
class GpioReal : public GpioBase<GpioReal> {
public:
    void set(uint8_t value) {
        printf("%s() called with value: %d\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, value);
    }
};

} // namespace templates
```

<Aside type="note">
Note how we change the name of the function in the derived class. This is a good idea, because if you don't you can quickly get into recursion in the base class when it calls `static_cast<T*>(this)->set(value);`. This will likely lead to a stack blow out and possibly a segmentation fault.
</Aside>

And a similarly derived class for a fake GPIO:

```c++ title="templates/GpioFake.hpp"
#include "GpioBase.hpp"

class GpioFake : public GpioBase<GpioFake> {
public:
    void set(uint8_t value) {
        printf("%s() called with value: %d\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, value);
    }
};
```

We can demonstrate this with the following `main()` function below. C++17 or later is required for template parameter deduction.

```c++ title="templates/main.cpp"
#include <cstdio>

#include "templates/App.hpp"
#include "templates/GpioFake.hpp"
#include "templates/GpioReal.hpp"

namespace tpl = templates;
namespace vm = virtual_methods;

int main() {
    // If we were in the real main()
    {
        tpl::GpioReal realGpio;
        tpl::App app(realGpio); // Template parameter deduction, no <GpioReal> needed!
        app.run();
    }

    // If we were in the test main()
    {
        tpl::GpioFake fakeGpio;
        tpl::App app(fakeGpio);
        app.run();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This gives us the following output:

```
void templates::GpioReal::set(uint8_t)() called with value: 1
void templates::GpioFake::set(uint8_t)() called with value: 1
```

Notice how we get the same polymorphism capabilities as we did with virtual methods, but these operations are performed at compile time and there should be no additional runtime overhead.

Because the casting of `this` to a pointer to `T` is going to be very common in a large base class, we can add a helper method called `self()` to make this easier (I saw this idea on StackOverflow[^stackoverflow-confusion-around-crtp-static-polymorphism]):

```c++
template <typename T>
class GpioBase {
public:
    T& self() { return static_cast<T&>(*this); }

    void set(uint8_t value) {
        // This is where the magic happens
        // NOTE Intellisense will not be able to give you any help on what properties the class T has,
        // this is one of the disadvantages of template polymorphism.
        self().set(value);
    }
};
```

## C++ Concepts

C++ concepts allow us to expand on the idea of using templates to implement static polymorphism. They allow us to enforce the derived classes implement the required methods, just as `virtual my_func() = 0` enforces this for dynamic polymorphism.

Without concepts, in the above template example, the only thing the compiler will enforce is that the derived class has a `set()` method and tha it can be passed a `uint8_t`. If you happened to define the derived function as `void set(int32_t value)`, it would still work fine. Likewise, if you added a return value and defined it as `bool set(int32_t value)`, it would still be happy. You can start to see how the enforcement of the API of the derived class are loose. Concepts can help tighten this up!

Roger Booth shows a way of using concepts along with inheritance to provide better compiler errors. However, you do have to define the functions in the base class, even though you have already defined them in the concept, and will also have to define them in the derived classes.[^medium-using-crtp-and-cpp20-concepts-for-static-polymorphism] Thomas Sedlmair shows a method which doesn't involve inheritance, and also gets around the hassle of having to define the functions in the base class.[^coding-with-thomas-crtp-and-concepts] We will use this method in our example below.

### Concepts with Inheritance


### Concepts with No Inheritance

```c++ title="concepts/GpioBase.hpp"
template <typename T>
concept Gpio = requires(T t, uint8_t value) {
    t.set(value);
};

// Empty base class, the concept will force the derived class to implement the set method
template <Gpio T>
class GpioBase : public T {};
```

Then define a real derived class:

```c++ title="concepts/GpioReal.hpp"
#include "GpioBase.hpp"

class GpioRealImpl {
public:
    void set(uint8_t value) {
        printf("%s() called with value: %d\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, value);
    }

};

// This alias is important so we don't have to use GpioBase<GpioRealImpl> everywhere, and it means this
// concept will be checked even if it's not used anywhere.
using GpioReal = GpioBase<GpioRealImpl>;
```

Note that `Impl` is added to the end of the class name, because we don't end up using that class in other code, we will use the alias `GpioReal` instead.

Our `App.hpp` can be identical to the one we used for the non-concept template example above:

```c++ title="concepts/App.hpp"
#include "GpioBase.hpp"

template <typename T>
class App {
public:
    App(GpioBase<T>& gpio) : gpio(gpio) {}

    void run() {
        gpio.set(1);
    }

private:
    GpioBase<T>& gpio;
};
```

And our `main.cpp` looks very similar to the others:

```c++ title="main.cpp"
#include "GpioBase.hpp"
#include "GpioReal.hpp"
#include "GpioFake.hpp"
#include "App.hpp"
int main() {
    // If we were in the real main()
    {
        GpioReal realGpio;
        App app(realGpio);
        app.run();
    }

    // If we were in the test main()
    {
        GpioFake fakeGpio;
        App app(fakeGpio);
        app.run();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Further Reading

[GuillaumeDua/cpp_legacy_inheritance_vs_std_variant.md](https://gist.github.com/GuillaumeDua/0239fda353264b67ddcb39b5d9a01105) is a good overview of standard dynamic polymorphism vs. static polymorphism via CRTP. It covers best practises for base classes such as making the constructor private and make the base class a `friend` of it's derived class. It also covers the use of `std::variant` and `std::visit` to create containers which can hold any of the derived types.

## Summary

So we have looked at a number of different ways to implement a HAL in C++ for an embedded system. Dynamic polymorphism via inheritance and virtual methods feels  the most natural and easiest to understand, however has the runtime burden of a `vtable` lookup. Whether or not that is a concern for your HAL implementation is something you must decide.

We can achieve static polymorphism via templates and the CRTP, which eliminates the runtime overhead of virtual methods. Given for a HAL on an embedded system all the types would be known at compile time, losing runtime polymorphism is not a big deal. The biggest downside is that the code feels a little more clunky to write, and you don't get the automatic "you have forgot to implement this method" compile time error that `virtual my_func() = 0` provides.

C++ concepts go some way to improving the developer experience of static polymorphism.

Some other languages like Rust default to compile time polymorphism (this is provided by Rust's Traits and Generics). In Rust, the compile time polymorphism feels much more natural and terse than in C++ (Rust also provided dynamic polymorphism via Trait objects and the `dyn` keyword).[^matt-oswalt-polymorphism-in-rust]
