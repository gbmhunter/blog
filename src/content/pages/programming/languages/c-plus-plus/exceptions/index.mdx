Exceptions are a supported form of error handling in C++. They allow the code write to throw and catch exceptions which can propagate through the call stack.

Note that it is common practice to use `e` to represent a variable that is of an exception type.

C++ is one of the "lowest level" languages that supports exceptions. Other low-level languages such as C do not have exception support.

## Notation

```c    
try {
	// Do error-prone stuff here
} catch(exception_type exception) {
	// Catch an exception of type exception_type here
}
```

## How The Exceptions Work

### The Standard Exceptions

`std::exception` doesn't support an additional message (it doesn't have an `e.what()`).

The standard exceptions are defined in `<stdexcept>`. They are split into categories:

### Logic Errors

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Exception</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>domain_error</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>invalid_argument</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>length_error</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>logic_error</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>out_of_range</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Runtime Errors

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>overflow_error</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>range_error</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>runtime_error</code></td>
      <td>Use <code>std::runtime_error</code> for general errors that occur in the running of your program.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>underflow_error</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### My Exception Message (e.what() Is Not Saying The Right Thing!

The most common reason for this is that you have forgotten to catch by reference (`&`)! Make sure that your catch statement looks like this:

```c++    
catch(std::exception& e) {}
```

and not like this:

```c++    
catch(std::exception e) {}
```

Remember, the standard rule for exceptions in C++ is:
 
> throw by value, catch by reference

## C++11 Additions

C++11 added new exception types to the standard library.

One is the `std::system_error`. It inherits from `std::runtime_error`. It is typically thrown by functions which interact with the operating system. It has two members, the standard `what()`, and a new `code()`. Calling `code()` returns the error code associated with the error.

Here is an example:

```c++    
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <system_error>

int main() {
	try {
		std::thread().detach(); // attempt to detach a non-thread
	}	catch(const std::system_error& e)	{
		std::cout << "Caught system_error with code " << e.code() 
		<< " meaning " << e.what() << '\n';
	}
}
```
   
Notice that the `error_code` object returns by `code()` can be inserted into a `ostream`.

This new system_error object with the additional `code()` method presents problems when using the standard catch, as other exceptions do not have this method. You can either write two separate catch statements (my preferred method).

```c++    
try {}
catch (const std::system_error& e) {
    std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
    std::cout << e.code() << '\n';
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cout << e.what() << '\n'; 
}
```

Or you can use a `dynamic_cast` like below.

```c++   
try {}
catch (const std::exception& e) {
	std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
	auto se = dynamic_cast<const std::system_error*>(&e);
	if(se != nullptr)
		std::cout << se->code() << '\n';
}
```

## The noexcept Keyword

The noexcept keyword was added to the C++ language in C++11. It can used to specify a function which is guaranteed to not throw an exception.

```c++    
void example() noexcept;
```

The above declaration states that `example()` is a function which does not throw an exception.

The compiler treats all C++ functions as either _non-throwing_ or _potentially-throwing_.

`noexcept` can be also be passed a boolean, passing in true to state that the function is non-throwing or false to state that it is potentially throwing.

```c++    
void example1() noexcept(true); // example1() is non-throwing
void example2() noexcept(false); // example2() is potentially-throwing
```

**Why Use noexcept?**

So why use noexcept? One on the primary reasons for using noexcept is so that the compiler can perform certain optimizations it wouldn't otherwise be able to do. A common example of this is the std::move_if_noexcept() function, which can be used in the implementation of things such a `std::vector<T>::push_back()`. If the compiler is able to determine that a function is non-throwing, it can **use move operations instead of copy operations**, which usually leads to performance increases.

**What Happens If I Throw Inside A Function Declared noexcept?**

The compiler doesn't actually guarantee that exceptions are not thrown in a non-throwing function. However, the behaviour of an exception thrown inside a function declared as noexcept is changed. Instead of the exception propagating up the call stack to the nearest applicable catch block, std::terminate() is called.

<Aside type="caution">
Do not get `noexcept` confused with `std::nothrow`. `noexcept` is a C++ language keyword as explained above, while `std::nothrow` is a constant that can be passed into the new operator.
