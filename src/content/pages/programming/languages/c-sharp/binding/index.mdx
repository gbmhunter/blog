The best tutorial of Binding in WPF that I've found is [here](http://blog.cylewitruk.com/2010/09/wpf-combobox-and-databinding-datacontext-itemssource-displaymemberpath-selecteditem-selectedvalue-selectedvaluepath/#comment-4032). It includes a project download which is great for binding that works out-of-the-box, which you can then hack/adjust to your own needs.

## ObservableCollection

The `ObservableCollection()`  class is used plenty when it comes to binding.

## Searching For And Selecting A Particular Element

The following code searches through an observable collection and finds items based a string match with one of the elements properties.

```c#    
var observC = new ObservableCollection();

// Search through collection
var searchRes = observC.Where(item => item.Name == "test");

// Obtain single element
var singleElement = searchRes.Take(0);
```

## Obtaining The Current DataContext For A UI Element

Obtaining the current DataContext for a particular UI element us useful when you want to set-up binding. The following code shows how to get the data context, obtaining the data context for the entire window (because it uses `this`, but you could replace this with any particular UI element if you wish).

```c#    
class Window1 : Window {
    private void GetViewModel() {
        viewmodel vm = (viewmodel)this.DataContext;
    }
}
```
