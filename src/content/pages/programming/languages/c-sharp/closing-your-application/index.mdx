title: Closing Your Application
type: page

## WPF

A common way to close the application is to use the following command:

```c#    
Application.Current.Shutdown();
```

However, although your main form will close, this can sometimes leave remnants (e.g. processes) running in the background. If this is happening, I have found that the following way exits everything:

```c# 
// The parameter is an exit code, use 0 if you
// are not concerned about this.
Environment.Exit(0);
```
