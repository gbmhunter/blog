<WarningIsNotes />

uv is a popular tool from Astral for managing Python environments and dependencies.

## Basic Usage

To create a new uv based project in your current working directory, run the following command:

```bash
uv init
```

If you have an existing project that uses a `dependencies.txt` file, you can add all the dependencies into your uv project with:

```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

This will add all the dependencies into the `pyproject.toml` file.
