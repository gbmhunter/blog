Bleak (Bluetooth Low Energy platform Agnostic Klient)[^github-bleak-repo] is a [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](/electronics/communication-protocols/bluetooth/) library for [Python](/programming/languages/python/). It is a cross-platform library that supports Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is built on top of the `asyncio` Python library.

It can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak).

## Installation

Install Bleak with pip:

```sh
pip install bleak
```

It's recommended to install Bleak in a virtual environment (create one with `python -m venv .venv`, and then activate it).

## Basic Usage

Bleak uses asyncio, so you need to run it in an asyncio event loop.

To scan for devices, you can use the following code:

```python
import asyncio
from bleak import BleakScanner

async def main():
    devices = await BleakScanner.discover()
    for d in devices:
        print(d)

asyncio.run(main())
```

When I ran this at home, I got the following output:

```sh
64:33:DB:9A:4C:1B: SAJ_Twoleg_S002594
E0:03:6B:B3:07:03: None
21:F3:9C:4A:0A:16: None
C6:EF:69:E2:77:B2: GN
50:0F:D7:2C:0F:4E: None
DC:CD:18:18:66:A0: Pokemon GO Plus +
70:D5:98:56:8B:E1: None
```

Here is a simple example that connects to BLE device and reads the model number, based of it's MAC address:

```python
import asyncio
from bleak import BleakClient

address = "24:71:89:cc:09:05"
MODEL_NBR_UUID = "2A24"

async def main(address):
    async with BleakClient(address) as client:
        model_number = await client.read_gatt_char(MODEL_NBR_UUID)
        print("Model Number: {0}".format("".join(map(chr, model_number))))

asyncio.run(main(address))
```

A context manager is used (the `with` above), which removes the need to manually disconnect from the device (it will automatically disconnect when the context manager exits).

As part of the connection process, Bleak will scan for BLE devices until it finds one that matches the MAC address.

Bleak will raise a `BleakDeviceNotFoundError` exception if it cannot find the device.

To get debug information from Bleak, you can import `logging` and set the logging level to `DEBUG`:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Backends

On Windows, Bleak uses the `winrt` (Windows Runtime) backend. On Linux, it communicates with BlueZ via DBus. On macOS, it interfaces with the CoreBluetooth API[^bleak-docs-backend-implementations].
