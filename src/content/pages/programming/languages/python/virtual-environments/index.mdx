When writing a Python application, you will likely pull in a number of third party libraries, typically installed by a package manager such as `pip` or `conda`. The application will typically depend on a specific version of each library (or a narrow range of versions). This can cause conflicts if other Python applications on your computer require different versions of the same package.

The solution to this problem is to **create a separate installation space for all of the libraries, specific to the application that uses them**. This is called a _virtual environment_.

Prior to v3, Python had a few popular third party frameworks for creating virtual environments. However, since Python 3, `virtualenv` is now bundled with Python and has become the de facto standard.

## virtualenv 

### Installation

Started at Python 3, virtualenv is installed as `venv` with your Python installation. For Python 2.x users, you can install virtualenv with:

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv # Python 2.x users only
```

### Creating a Virtual Environment

`env` will be the name of the virtual environment.

```python
python -m venv env
```

This will create a directory called `env` in your current working directory.

### Activating a Virtual Environment

Activating a virtual environment is necessary before you can use it. Activating it modifies your shell environment to calls to `python` and `pip` use the virtual environments installation and not any system-wide installation. Unfortunately, the way to enable it differs between Unix/macOS and Windows. You have to keep this in mind when writing code that should run on many OSes.

To activate (on UNIX or macOS):

```bash
$ source env/bin/activate
```

To activate (on Windows):

```batch
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

To deactivate (on all OSes):

```bash
$ deactivate
```

### Saving Dependencies to a `requirements.txt`

To save all the libraries to a `requirements.txt` (Linux or Windows `cmd.exe`):

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Be careful if running the above command in PowerShell on Windows! By default, PowerShell will probably not use `UTF-8` encoding but a non-standard `UTF-16 LE`. To prevent this, use the following command instead:

```powershell
pip freeze | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 requirements.txt
```

### Activating a Virtual Environment Inside a Batch File

If you are typing commands inside a Windows Batch file (`.bat`), you can't just use the line `.venv/Scripts/activate` to activate the virtual environment. You will need to activate the virtual environment with `call` like this:

```batch
call .venv\Scripts\activate
```

## pipenv

pipenv is a third-party Python virtual environment framework alternative to the built-in `venv`.

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install --user pipenv
```
