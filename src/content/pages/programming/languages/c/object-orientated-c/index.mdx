Although C is not generally thought of as an object-orientated language, it's flexibility does allow **object-orientated style code** to be written, albeit with slightly more verbose syntax than a "object-orientated" language such as C++. Why would you want to do this? Well, there are a number of reasons:

* **Organization**: We humans tend to think of the world in terms of objects and their interactions. Writing code in the same style can make it easier to understand. It helps bundle data and functions that operate on that data into the same files, making them easier to maintain.
* **Testing**: Inheritance along with dependency injection can allow you to write code which is easier to test (more on this below).
* **Flexibility**: Writing code in an object-orientated style naturally makes it easy to create many instances of objects, which can be harder in imperative languages when you rely on file local or global variables.
* **Clear Data Ownership**: Using an OO style means your are more likely to bundle data into `structs` and less likely to rely on file local or global variables that are defined outside of any function in a `.c` file. This is a good thing. File local or global data makes it harder to understand what happens when functions are called, and makes it easier to introduce bugs such as multiple threads accessing the same data without synchronisation. When data is bundled into objects, you are forced to pass the object around to all functions that need it, making developers aware of what data is used where.

Object-orientated code is a broad term for a number of different coding ideas. These include:

* _Encapsulation_. An object encapsulates all of it's data and functions (called methods in the object-orientated world).
* _Abstraction_. The user of an object can only see and use it's public interface, and has no knowledge of it's internal workings.
* _Polymorphism_.
* _Inheritance_.

The above points can be implemented in C with varying levels of success and simplicity. 

Also miss out on compiler-enforced encapsulation and abstraction.

## Defining the Basic Object

In C, _structures_ (`typedef struct`) can be used to represent an "object". Below is C code which defines a very simple object, which only holds data and contains no functions. Think of a `struct` in C being the equivalent of a `class` in dedicated OO-languages.

```c
typedef struct {
    double real;
    double imag;
} ComplexNum;
```

We would then create an instance of our object with the code:

```c 
void main () {
    ComplexNum myComplexNum;
    myComplexNum.real = 3.4;
    myComplexNum.imag = 5.7;
}
```

Note that by itself, the above code is not very object-orientated, as even non-OO styled C would make extensive use of structures. This is where methods come in (functions which belong to an object).

## Methods

A method is just a name for a **function which belongs to an object**. When we say "belong" we mean that the function can **manipulate the data** or call other methods of a particular object instance.

In stronger OO languages, methods are declared as part of a _class_, and a pointer to the current instance of the object (the keyword `this`) is automatically passed into each method. We don't have such luxuries in C, and so have to declare our methods as normal functions, and pass in the pointer to the object instance explicitly. You would normally want to do this as the first argument for consistency. Here we just call it `obj`.

```c
double ComplexNum_GetMagnitude(ComplexNum const * obj) {
    return sqrt(obj->real * obj->real + obj->imag * obj->imag);
}
```

The first (and only, in this case) argument passed into this "method" is a pointer to instance of a `ComplexNum` object that you wish to operate on. **All non-static methods of an object will have this as their first argument.**

<Aside type="caution">
It's wise not to use the variable name `this` to pass in the object, as it is a reserved word in C++[^uni-of-missouri-cpp-reserved-words].
</Aside>

## Wait, What About A Constructor?

In OO-universe, a constructor is a special method which is run automatically when a new instance of an object is created. Unfortunately, in C, there is no way to enforce a method to run upon creation of our `struct` object (o.k., yes you could wrap the creation of a struct inside a macro which also called a method).

A simple way to have constructor-like behaviour is to create an `Init()` method.

```c
void ComplexNum_Init(complexNum_t * obj) {
    obj->real = 0.0;
    obj->imag = 0.0;
}
```

The downside of this is that we have to remember to call it every time we create a new `complexNum_t` object.
    
```c
void main() {
    complexNum_t myComplexNum;
    // We have to remember to call the "constructor"
    // If we forget, bad things could happen
    ComplexNum_Init(&myComplexNum);
}
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the ability to define a new object/class which is a modified (extended) version of an existing object/class. One use case for inheritance for embedded C is to make code testable. Inheritance can be used to abstract hardware specific implementations out from code you want to test on, say Linux, which doesn't have access to GPIO and other hardware peripherals (through special memory mapped registers).

<IRef iref="fig-gpio-inheritance-diagram" /> shows how the basic inheritance structure for our example GPIO driver.

<IRef iref="fig-gpio-real-vs-testing-swimlane-diagram" /> shows how the real application and testing application would start-up, create the appropriate GPIO object and pass it to the module.

Notice how the module does not depends on either child class, meaning that it run both on a real hardware or in a testing environment on Linux just fine. A different `main()` function, is used to the build the embedded application compared to the testing application. This allows each to create an instance of their respective GPIO class. This GPIO instance is then passed to the module (this is known as dependency injection). When passing it, you can either just pass the `.base` portion of the `struct`, or cast the entire `struct` to the base class type (this works because the `.base` portion is the first member of the `struct`).

## Interfacing To Imperative Code

You may be happy-as-Larry, writing all your C code in an OO style. But what happens when you want to interface with third-party (or previously written) code which is written in the standard C "imperative" style.

The example I will use is based around the PSoC family of microcontrollers. When you create a new UART for the microcontroller (via the graphical schematic editor in the PSoC Creator IDE), the PSoC libraries provide an associated set of functions to control the UART (e.g., if you had named the UART component `CyUart1`, then you would be given functions such as `CyUart1_Start()`, `CyUart2_Read()`, e.t.c). This functions are not written in an OO-style.

The solution I propose is to create your own object-orientated UART driver, which wraps provides an interface from the imperative-style PSoC UART functions to the rest of your OO code.

Here is an complete, working example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

//========== MOCK CYPRESS API FOR UART ================//

void CyUart1_Start() {
    printf("CyUart1_Start() called.\r\n");
}

void CyUart1_Stop() {
    printf("CyUart1_Stop() called.\r\n");
}

void CyUart1_Read() {
    printf("CyUart1_Read() called.\r\n");
}

void CyUart1_Write() {
    printf("CyUart1_Write() called.\r\n");
}

//=============== OUR UART DRIVER ================//

typedef struct {
    void (* CyUart_Start)(void);
    void (* CyUart_Stop)(void);
    uint8_t (* CyUart_Read)(void);
    void (* CyUart_Write)(uint8_t byte);
} uart_t;

void Uart_Init(uart_t * obj,
    void (* CyUart_Start)(void),
    void (* CyUart_Stop)(void),
    uint8_t (* CyUart_Read)(void),
    void (* CyUart_Write)(uint8_t byte)) {
    
    obj->CyUart_Start = CyUart_Start;
    obj->CyUart_Stop = CyUart_Stop;
    obj->CyUart_Read = CyUart_Read;
    obj->CyUart_Write = CyUart_Write;
            
}

void Uart_Start(uart_t * obj) {
    obj->CyUart_Start();
}

void Uart_Stop(uart_t * obj) {
    obj->CyUart_Stop();
}

uint8_t Uart_Read(uart_t * obj) {
    return obj->CyUart_Read();
}

void Uart_Write(uart_t * obj, uint8_t byte) {
    obj->CyUart_Write(byte);
}

#define GET_CY_UART_FUNCTIONS(prefix) \
    prefix##_Start, \
    prefix##_Stop, \
    prefix##_Read, \
    prefix##_Write

//=============== MAIN PROGRAM ================//

int main(void) {
    
    uart_t myUart;
    
    Uart_Init(&myUart, GET_CY_UART_FUNCTIONS(CyUart1));
    
    Uart_Start(&myUart);
    uint8_t byte = Uart_Read(&myUart);
    Uart_Write(&myUart, 0x2A);
    Uart_Stop(&myUart);

    return 0;
}
```
