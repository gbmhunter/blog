title: The Confusing Differences Between struct and typedef struct
type: page
---


## Overview

It's rather unfortunate that the syntax around defining a `struct` in the C programming language can be confusing, especially the behaviour differences between using `struct` and `typedef struct`. This page will hopefully clear up the confusion!

## Just Using a Tag

If you define a `struct` with just a tag, i.e. `struct <tag>`, you get no created variables, and you have to type `struct <tag>` everytime you want to make one. For example, if we type:

```c
struct Person {
  uint8_t age;
  char name[50];
};
```

You then create a variable of this type with:

```c
struct Person my_person;
```

## Tag and Variable

What happens if we add a word after the `}` but before the `;`? This creates a variable of the struct type that we can use:

```c
struct Person {
  uint8_t age;
  char name[50];
} my_person;
```

We can now use this struct variable:

```c
// Now we get one struct already created for us
my_person.age = 4;
// We can still now make more variables of this type
struct Person my_person2;
```

## Typedef

Now most of the confusion comes from when you add `typedef` into the mix. If you add `typedef` to the front of the `struct` definition like this:

```c
typedef struct Person {
  uint8_t age;
  char name[50];
} Person;
```

This changes the meaning of the word after the `}`, it now becomes an `alias` for the struct type, and not the name of a variable as it did above. What this does is save you having to type `struct Person` all the time, now you can just type `Person`. This is why most people use `typedef` with `struct`.

```c
Person my_person;
```

Note that I have used the same word `Person` as the typedef `alias` as I did for the `struct` tag. This is fine, there will be no naming collisions, and I could still create variables using `struct Person` if I wanted to.

You can also leave out the last `Person` when defining a struct using `typedef`, but there is not much point in this!

```c
typedef struct Person {
  uint8_t age;
  char name[50];
} Person;
```

What you will see often though is people using `typedef struct` and then skipping the tag, and only providing an alias at the end:

```c
typedef struct {
  uint8_t age;
  char name[50];
} Person;
```

Which then allows you to use the word `Person` as a type, but not `struct Person` (which is generally acceptable):

```c
Person my_person; // This works
struct Person my_person; // This won't (but this is normally fine!)
```
