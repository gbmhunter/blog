<WarningIsNotes />

Control statements in the C programming language are constructs which allow you to **conditionally execute pieces of code**, based on whether a condition is true or false.

The most basic C control statement is the if statement. The C programming language has many different control statements, including if-else, if-elseif-else, while, for, and switch.
