title: C Naming Conventions

This page explains my preferred naming convention style for C code.

## Variables

All local variables (variables within a function) begin with a lower-case letter and use camel-case, including function pointers. Only the first letter in an acronym is capitalised, e.g.

```c
void MyFunction() {
    uint8_t activeGpsAnt;
}
```

All file-level and global variable use the same syntax except with an underscore in front of them.

```c    
uint8_t _activeGpsAnt;

void MyFunction() {
    // code here...
}
```

## Functions

Functions start with the file/module name, an underscore, and then a description. All functions use camel-case and begin with a capital letter. For example, a function in a file called Gps.c would look like...

```c    
void Gps_GetLocation();
```

## Typedefs

Typedefs aways end in `_t`. The helps the reader instantly distinguish a data type from anything else, and also serves to distinguish user defined data types (e.g. `uint8_t`, `myType_t`) from system data types (e.g. `char`, `double`, `int`).

## Acronyms

When it comes to capitalisation rules, acronyms are treated if they were a standard word, and only the first letter of the acronym is capitalised. For example, if you had a GPS variable, it would be named:

```c    
bool gpsEnabled = true;
```

Similarly, for functions:

```c   
Gps_SetEnabled();
```
