## Terminology

A CSV file is made up of many **records**, where a record is a single entire line in the file. Each new line is signified with the **record delimiter** (typically a carriage return and line feed character, `CRLF` or `\r\n`). A record is made up of many **fields**, each which are separated by the **field delimiter** (typically a comma or a tab character).

## General Rules

1. Each record is located on a different line, and each line is separated by the carriage return and line break characters (the record delimiter).
2. The last record in the file may or may not have a record delimiter at the end of it.  

    ```csv
    xxx,yyy,zzz CRLF (record delimiter on last line)  
    ```

    or  

    ```csv
    xxx,yyy,zzz (no record delimiter on last line)  
    ```

3. There is an optional header record at the top of the file (the first line), with the same format as the rest of the records. The header contains names/descriptions of the fields in the file.  

    ```csv
    Field1Name, Field2Name, Field3Name  

    aaa,bbb,ccc  

    xxx,yyy,zzz  
    ```

4. White-space (space and tab characters) are considered part of the field, and shall be preserved (i.e. not stripped) when parsing CSV files.
	
# Standards

There is no "official" standard for CSV files, however, [RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) stands as the de facto standard (it formally registers the MIME type "text/csv").

## Excel

Excel supports the reading and writing of data to/from CSV files. One thing to watch out for when reading CSV files is that Excel will try and deduce the type of each data field. Some deductions are non-intuitive, such as Excels conversion of numbers within quotes to scientific notation.

For example, the data `12345678901234567890` will be shown as `1.23457E+19` (without highlighting the cell) when naively opened in Excel. The number in the cell will be `12345678901234500000` (still wrong).
