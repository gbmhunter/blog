YAML, or **YAML Ain't Markup Language**, is a human-readable data serialization format. It is commonly used to store configuration data for software applications.

The official site can be found at [https://yaml.org/](https://yaml.org/) (which is written in YAML format!!!).

JSON is a valid subset of the YAML specification, which means a `.json` file is a valid YAML file, and you can embed JSON syntax inside a YAML file.

## History

YAML initially stood for **Yet Another Markup Language**. However, it was later changed to **YAML Ain't Markup Language** (a recursive acronym) to emphasize its data-oriented nature and distinguish it from document markup[^wikipedia-yaml].

## A List

All members of a basic list start with `- ` (a hash and a space):

```yaml
colors:
    - red
    - green
    - blue
```

You can also specify a list in a much more condensed form:

```yaml
colors: ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

This terser syntax is called a _Flow collection_.

## A Collection (Dictionary)

All items in a dictionary take the form `key: value` (there must be a space after the colon):

```yaml
my_dict:
    date: 2019-01-01
    color: red
    location: north
```

## Comments

YAML comments begin with a `#` (hash symbol, or Octothorpe if you're feeling fancy).

```yaml
# This is a comment
```

## PyYAML

Interestingly, Python is not shipped with a built-in YAML parser. The most popular library for parsing YAML in Python is PyYAML (`pyyaml`). You can install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

<Aside type="tip">
Even though the package is called `pyyaml`, the module you import (see below) is just `yaml`.
</Aside>

Here is an example of how to read a YAML file:

```python
import yaml

with open("config.yaml", "r") as file:
    config = yaml.safe_load(file)
```

### Line Width

By default, `yaml.dump` inserts new lines when a line reaches around 80-100 characters. You can change this with the `width` parameter:

```python
yaml.dump(data, width=200) # Longer lines
yaml.dump(data, width=float("inf")) # Infinitely long lines
```

### Prevent Aliases

By default, PyYAML will use aliases to when it comes across references to the same object in memory when serializing (dumping). The following example shows a basic example which doesn't use aliases, because string assignment in Python creates a new object:

```python
data = {}
data['name'] = 'Bob'
data['name_copy'] = data['name']
print(yaml.dump(data))
# Output:
# name: Bob
# name_copy: Bob
```

But things happen differently for a `datetime` object, in where the assignment just takes a reference to the object:
  
```python
data = {}
data['date'] = datetime.datetime.now().date()
data['date_copy'] = data['date']
print(yaml.dump(data))
# Output:
# date: &id001 2024-09-01
# date_copy: *id001
```

`date_copy` is now just `*id001`, which is an _alias_ (think: reference) to the `date` object above which has been given the _anchor_ `&id001`[^bitbucket-yaml-anchors]. While this is valid YAML (and in fact it's required to work this way, see below), in many cases it's not what you want. Some parsers may not handle aliases correctly, and it also makes it hard to a user to read or update things (imagine a big file with many aliases!). I would submit that most of time it's preferable to copy the data. To do this, you need to tell PyYAML to ignore aliases. You can do this on a global level with:

<Aside type="tip">
Section 3.1.1 of the YAML spec requires anchors and aliases to be used when serializing multiple references to the same node (data object)[^ttl255-yaml-anchors-and-aliases]. So this explains PyYAML's default behaviour.
</Aside>

```python
yaml.SafeDumper.ignore_aliases = lambda *args : True
```

Or even better, you can subclass `yaml.SafeDumper` and override the `ignore_aliases` method. This has the advantage of not being a global change and affecting other parts of your code (unless that's what you want):

```python
# As per https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/535
class VerboseSafeDumper(yaml.SafeDumper):
    def ignore_aliases(self, data):
        return True

yaml.dump(Dumper=VerboseSafeDumper)
```

Either of these methods would then result in `yaml.dump()` giving you a string like this:

```python
# Output:
# date: 2024-09-01
# date_copy: 2024-09-01
```
