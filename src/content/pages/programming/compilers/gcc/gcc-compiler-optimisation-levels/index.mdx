## Fancy Optimisations

<p>One aspect of GCC optimisation that still amazes me is it's ability to convert specific repetitive operations into highly-efficient mathematical sequence equations.</p>

<p>One example is that GCC can convert an function in where you sum all the integers up to the number specified as an input variable using a for loop, into the equation <code>x * (x + 1) / 2</code>.</p>

<p>This is covered in more detail at <a href="http://blog.xebia.com/gcc-compiler-optimizations-dissection-of-a-benchmark/">http://blog.xebia.com/gcc-compiler-optimizations-dissection-of-a-benchmark/</a>.</p>
