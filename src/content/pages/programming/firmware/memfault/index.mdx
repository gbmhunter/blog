Memfault is a commercial cloud-based service designed for managing and analysing faults/data from a fleet of internet-connected embedded devices. It also allows you to manage and deploy OTA (over-the-air) updates to your devices.

## Dashboard

Memfault has a web-based dashboard for viewing data from your devices and managing things like OTA updates.

## Heartbeats

Heartbeats are one of the common ways of sending data from your embedded device to Memfault. Not only do they indicate to Memfault that your device is still alive, but heartbeats can also contain user-defined metrics that you can use to monitor things like battery life, temperature, and more.

As of June 2024, all Memfault pricing plans allow up to 24 heartbeats per day[^memfault-pricing].

Heartbeats can be triggered manually with `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_debug_trigger()`.

## Metrics

Metrics are parameters you can track on your embedded device. The data is cached locally and sent to Memfault on the next heartbeat.

Metrics are defined with `MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE()` macro in your `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def` file[^memfault-metrics-api].

The macro takes two parameters, the name of the metric and it's type. For example:

```c
MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(my_metric, kMemfaultMetricType_Unsigned);
```

Then, in your code, you can set/update the metric with `MEMFAULT_METRIC_SET_xxx()` or `MEMFAULT_METRIC_ADD()` marcos:

```c
#include "memfault/metrics/metrics.h"

void main() {
    // ...
    MEMFAULT_METRIC_SET_UNSIGNED(my_metric, 1234); // Directly set the metric to 1234
    MEMFAULT_METRIC_ADD(my_metric, 1); // Increment the metric by 1
    // ...
}
```

The following metric types are supported[^memfault-metrics-api]:

- `kMemfaultMetricType_Signed`
- `kMemfaultMetricType_Unsigned`
- `kMemfaultMetricType_Timer`
- `kMemfaultMetricType_String`

<Aside type="note">
Notice there is no `float` type. Any float values you want to record as metrics will need to converted into appropriately scaled integer values first.
</Aside>

You can either manually define metrics via the Memfault web dashboard or by uploading the built .elf file. You need to make sure you define your metrics, otherwise you won't see them come through, as Memfault will ignore any unrecognized metrics that are posted to it's API.

Memfault imposes quotas on the amount of different metrics you can have per project.

More about metrics can be read in the Memfault Docs [here](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/metrics).

## Traces

Memfault gives you the ability to send traces from your embedded device. A trace is designed to be sent when a significant issue occurs. By defaults, traces send you emails.

A popular type of trace is a "core dump" trace. This is a comprehensive trace that can contain stack traces for every thread, the state of the CPU registers, and the values of static variables. Core dumps traces require the `.elf` file of the application to be uploaded to Memfault. Each `.elf` file is associated with a specific version of the firmware.

## nRF Memfault Phone App

The nRF Memfault app by Nordic Semiconductor is a phone app (available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.memfault&hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-memfault/id1641119282)) which allows you to connect to devices running Memfault and publishing on the Memfault Diagnostic Service (MDS). The MDS is a [Bluetooth](/electronics/communication-protocols/bluetooth/) GATT service. The app connects to these devices and streams the "chunks" from the device to the Memfault cloud.

The nRF Memfault app displays the application key (project key) and device ID.

## Memfault CLI

Memfault CLI is a [Python](/programming/languages/python/) tool for interacting with the Memfault Cloud API via the command line. It is useful for automating tasks (as an alternative to using the manual web GUI) such as uploading firmware, symbol files, and more from your CI/CD pipeline.

### Installation

The Memfault CLI is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/) can be installed using `pip` with the command:

```bash
pip3 install memfault-cli
```

It is recommended to install the CLI in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.

## Using Memfault with Zephyr

Memfault has first-class support for the [Zephyr RTOS](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/).

### Kconfig Options

* `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_COLLECT_BSS_REGIONS`: Set to `y` to collect the BSS region (0 initialised data) of the application as part of the core dump. Defaults to `n`.
* `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_MAX_TRACKED_TASKS`: The maximum number of tasks that are tracked in the core dump. For each task, the task name, back trace (up to a limit) and task run state (e.g. `RUNNING`, `SUSPENDED`) are collected. Defaults to `32`.
* `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_LOGGING_ENABLE`: Set to `y` to route Zephyr log messages to the Memfault log system (i.e. install the Memfault logging backend into Zephyr). Defaults to `n`.

A complete list of the Memfault Kconfig options can be found [here](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/zephyr/Kconfig).

### Logging

Memfault supports sending log messages to the Memfault cloud. This is useful for debugging issues with your device.

<Aside type="caution">
It was not working for me when I was using the `MEMFAULT_SDK_LOG_SAVE()` macro. Then I discovered there is also a `MEMFAULT_LOG_SAVE()` macro. This worked!
</Aside>

### Memfault Shell Commands

Memfault provides a range of useful Zephyr shell commands that you can enable by setting `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_SHELL=y` in your `prj.conf` file. Once enabled, you should see a command called `mflt` available in the Zephyr shell. The following `mflt` sub-commands are available:

- `mflt get_core` - Get the core dump from the device (if one exists).
- `mflt test` - This contains a number of sub-commands for testing the Memfault integration.
