An external project in a CMake system is a separate, self-contained CMake project that can be turned into a target, which can then be used as a dependency on other targets in your build system.

The `ExternalProject` module runs it's commands at build time.

## Adding An External Project

An external project can be added with the command `ExternalProject_Add()`.

`CMAKE_ARGS` can be used to provide command-line style arguments to the `CMakeLists.txt` file in this external project.

You can use this to "pass-in parameters" to the called CMakeLists.txt file by using the `-D` option to create a cache entry.

```cmake
ExternalProject_Add(
    ...
    CMAKE_ARGS -DMY_VARIABLE=1
    ...
)
```

Add CMake-enabled projects to an existing CMake-enabled project can become quite a complex task.

## Difference Between ExternalProject_Add() And add_subdirectory()

It can be confusing when you want to add-in a CMake-managed project into your current project, which is also CMake-managed. There are a few ways of doing so, one being `ExternalProject_Add()` and the other `add_subdirectory()`. After-all, `add_subdirectory()` **doesn't have to actually be a subdirectory** (it can be any directory on the system).

`ExternalProject_Add()` is much more powerful than `add_subdirectory()`.
