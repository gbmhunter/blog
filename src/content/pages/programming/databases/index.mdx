A database is an organised collection of data stored in a computer, accessed via a well defined interface/language.

## Common Data Types

### Text Based

`VARCHAR` lets you store a variable length string, with a settable maximum length. It is likely the most commonly used data type for strings. Only the size of the string plus a small amount of overhead (1 byte if the string is less than 255 bytes, 2 bytes if it is 255 bytes or more) is stored in the table.[^planetscale-mysql-data-types-varchar-and-char]

## MySQL

A _record_ is the definition for a row in a table.

### Creating A Database

A single SQL instance can have one or more databases.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS my_database;
```

### Creating A Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE people(id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255))
```

If you only want to create a table if it doesn't already exist, you can use `IF NOT EXISTS`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people(id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255))
```

### Changing A Position Of A Column

MySQL/MariaDB are somewhat unique in that you can both **specify the insertion point of a column and change the position of an existing column**. Many other databases such as PostgreSQL do not let you do this, and new columns are always added to the end of the table. This does not matter so much for code-driven front ends which can render the columns in whatever order they choose, but this ability to insert a column at a point of your choosing is **really useful if you rely on generic database viewing tools such as DBeaver**.

To change the position of an existing column, by inserting after an existing column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name MODIFY COLUMN new_col_name column_definition AFTER existing_col_name;
```

If you want to insert the column as the first column, instead of `AFTER <existing_col_name>` use `FIRST`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name MODIFY COLUMN new_col_name column_definition FIRST;
```

More info at https://mariadb.com/kb/en/alter-table/.

### Checking If A Column Exists

You can use the `SHOW COLUMNS` command to check if a column exists in a table:

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE 'column_name'
```

For example, in Python:

```python
cur.execute(f'SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE \'column_name\'')
results = cur.fetchall()
if len(results) == 1:
    # Column column_name exists in table, do something here.
    pass
```

### Inserting A Record

To insert a record into a table, use the SQL `INSERT` command. Let's say we wanted to add a person called `josh` to the `people` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO people(name)
VALUES('josh');
```

To do the same thing from Python:

```python
cur.execute('INSERT INTO people(name) VALUES(%s);', ('josh',))
conn.commit()
```

### Updating A Record

The SQL command `UPDATE` is used to update existing records (table rows). Suppose we wanted to update the age of all people named `ben` to `11`:

```sql
UPDATE people SET age=11 WHERE name=ben
```

To do the same thing in Python:

```python
cur.execute(f'UPDATE people SET age=%s WHERE name=%s', (age, name, ))
conn.commit()
```

### Timestamps

The `TIMESTAMP` data type holds temporal data in the form of a date and time. It can be used

```sql
ALTER TABLE my_table_name ADD COLUMN my_timestamp_column TIMESTAMP
```

There is special behaviour defined for the first column of this type that you add to a table, it automatically gets the following properties applied to it:

* `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
* `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

This means that the column records will automatically default to the current datetime when it is first added. It also means that when any other data in the record is changed, the column will update to the current datetime (so it acts like a "last modified" field).

See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/timestamp/ for more info.

### Debug Info

You can get some debug info on the last foreign key failure by running the command:

```sql
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS 
```

## MariaDB

_MariaDB_ is a fully open-source, GPL licenced database engine that is designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL. Whilst MySQL supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS, MariaDB only supports Windows and Linux (no Mac OS support)[^geeks-for-geeks-mysql-vs-mariadb].

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a _object-orientated_ database. The main feature of a _object-orientated_ database is that tables can inherit from other tables, which means they automatically get all the data columns of the table they inherit from (similar to object inheritance in _object-orientated_ programming languages).

Inheritance is defined when creating tables with the `INHERITS` clause with the `CREATE TABLE` statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
    name            text,
    age             int
);

CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id      text,
) INHERITS (people);
```

If a table already exists, you can inheritance via the `INHERIT` variant of the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

PostgreSQL does not let you easily alter the position of a column in a table -- to do so you have to recreate the table with the desired column order.

### Working With PostgreSQL In Python

One of the most popular PostgreSQL libraries for Python is `psycopg2`. To install it on Ubuntu you will also need the `libpg-dev` package on your system:

```bash
sudo apt install libpq-dev
pip install psycopg2
```

## Microsoft SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server is a proprietary relational database engine developed by Microsoft. Microsoft Azure SQL Database is a cloud-based version of SQL Server, provided on Microsoft Azure. It is one of the supported database engines by DBeaver.

### Data Types

SQL Server offers both `datetime` and `datetime2` data types for storing date and time values. `datetime2` is an extension of `datetime` which has a larger date range, a larger default fractional precision, and optional user-specified precision.[^microsoft-sql-server-datetime2]

> Use the time, date, datetime2 and datetimeoffset data types for new work. These types align with the SQL Standard. They are more portable. time, datetime2 and datetimeoffset provide more seconds precision. datetimeoffset provides time zone support for globally deployed applications.

Data in the database is stored in two different types of files, primary data files with the `.mdf` extension and secondary data files with the `.ndf` extension. Logs are stored in files with the `.ldf` extension.[^wikipedia-microsoft-sql-server]

### Communicating with SQL Server from Python

The `pyodbc` library is a popular library for communicating with SQL Server from Python.

```bash
pip install pyodbc
```

You also have to install the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16). Drivers are available for Windows, Linux and macOS. This driver is used by `pyodbc` to communicate with the database.
