Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) are a type of shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. They are used to generate things such as pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) and pseudo-noise.

The input bit is determined by the state of the bits in the shift register. Because this is deterministic, as because the shift register can only contain a finite number of states, the sequence of bits outputted by the LFSR will eventually start to repeat. This sequence is known as the _period_ of the LFSR. It is generally desirable to chose the feedback function (the bits which are tapped/XORed together to give the input bit) such that the output seems random and have a long period.

The maximum period of an LFSR can never be greater than the number of states possible in shift register, minus 1 because the state of all $0$ bits is not allowed. This is $2^n - 1$ where $n$ is the number of bits in the shift register. For example, an LFSR with 8 bits can have a period of at most $2^8 - 1 = 255$ before it starts to repeat. The state of all $0$ bits is not allowed because in this case the output would never change.
