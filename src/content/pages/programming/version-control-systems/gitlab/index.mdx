GitLab is a web-based "dev ops" software system that provides Git server based hosting, bug tracking, CICD and more for software projects. It is a strong competitor to GitHub, especially for commercial uses.

## Container Registries

Each repo can have it's own container registry. You can use this to store Docker images relating to the project.

`CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE` is provided and is the base path for the container registry.

You can log into the repo's container registry inside a pipeline with the command:

```bash
echo $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER $CI_REGISTRY --password-stdin
```

Then you be able to push a built image:

```bash
docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE"
```

You can download images from the GitLab container registry to your local machine by first logging in:

```bash
docker login registry.gitlab.com
```

You will be prompted to enter your username and password. If you have 2FA enabled, you will have to substitute your password with a personal access token.

You can then download and run an image with:

```bash
docker run -it registry.gitlab.com/<org_name>/<project_path> bash
```

### GitLab CI Files

### Includes

You can include files in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the `include` keyword. This is useful for sharing common configuration between multiple projects.

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
```

You can also use the `ref` to specify a branch, tag or commit SHA when including a file. This is good for "version control" of your include dependencies.

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    ref: 'main' # Branch name
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    ref: 'v1.0.0' # Tag name
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    ref: 'b6901dcb0918db67a81b190d24fa67f0b5f99fdb' # Commit SHA
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
```

### Conditionally Running Jobs

Sometimes you will only want to run a job under certain conditions. You can do this by using the `rules` keyword.

Regex can be used with the `rules` keyword by using `=~`.

```yaml
my_job:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG =~ /^docker-image-v.*$/
  script:
    - echo "This job will only run for commits that are tagged with docker-image-v1, docker-image-v2 etc."
```

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure you don't wrap the regex in quotes. This is still a valid rule, but will not invoke the regex engine. For example, don't do this:

```yaml
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG =~ "^docker-image-v.*$"
```
</Aside>

### Running Jobs In Docker Containers

You can tell GitLab to run the job inside a Docker container by using the `image` keyword.

```yaml
my_job:
  image:
    name: my-docker-image
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - echo "This job will run in a Docker container with the image my-docker-image"
```

<Aside type="caution">
Remember to always add the `docker:dind` (Docker in Docker) service to `services` if you are using Docker images. This starts the Docker daemon inside the container.

```yaml
  services:
    - docker:dind
```
</Aside>

The default Docker user will be used by default. If you want to override this, you can change the structure of the `image` key a bit and add a `docker`/`user` key as shown below.

```yaml
my_job:
  image:
    name: my-docker-image
    docker:
      user: root
  script:
    - echo "This job will run in a Docker container with the image my-docker-image and as user root"
```

## Running Pipelines Locally

GitLab does not have official support for running pipelines locally, but there is a popular third-party tool called [gitlab-ci-local](https://github.com/firecow/gitlab-ci-local) (a.k.a. GCL) which allows you to do this.

### Installation

To install `gitlab-ci-local` on Debian-based UNIX distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), you can run the following command[^github-repo-gitlab-ci-local]:

```bash
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gitlab-ci-local.sources https://gitlab-ci-local-ppa.firecow.dk/gitlab-ci-local.sources
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gitlab-ci-local
```

### Running a Job

Clone the repository that contains the pipeline (i.e. has a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file) and run the following command:

```bash
gitlab-ci-local <job_name>
```

This will run the job locally and output the results to the console. You may need authentication for the job to run successfully, see the section below for details.

However, this will not run the job's dependencies, which might be what you were expecting. To run the job and all of it's dependencies, add the `--needs` flag:

```bash
gitlab-ci-local <job_name> --needs
```

`gitlab-ci-local` will cache the "dot env" of dependencies, so you don't need to keep using `--needs` during testing if the dependencies haven't changed. By default, `gitlab-ci-local` stores the cache of the artifacts at `.gitlab-ci-local/artifacts/<job_name>`. This is quite a convenient place to check if you need to debug a job.

### Manual Jobs

You can trigger a manual job to run during the execution of another job with `--manual <job_name>`. For example:

```bash
gitlab-ci-local build_firmware --manual my_manual_job
```

### GitLab Variables

When a pipeline is running on GitLab's servers, a number of pre-defined environment variables get provided that the pipeline scripts can use. When running them locally, `gitlab-ci-local` will do it's best to provide sensible defaults for these variables. However those dealing with authentication and other URLs will not work, as `gitlab-ci-local` cannot work out what these should be. In these cases, you can create a file called `.gitlab-ci-local-variables.yml` in the root directory of the repository and manually provide the variables.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci-local-variables.yml"
---
MY_VAR_1: <value_1>
MY_VAR_2: <value_2>
```

`CI_REGISTRY` defaults to `https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/`.

`CI_PROJECT_DIR` will be set to `/gcl-builds`, which should be where the root directory of the repository resides.

If `.gitlab-ci-local-variables.yml` ends up containing sensitive information like personal access tokens, do not commit this file to the repository! Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` file.

### Variables In Variables

It doesn't look like `gitlab-ci-local` supports defining variables using other variables. For example, this is works when running on GitLab:

```yaml
variables:
  MY_PATH: $MY_PATH /another/path 
```

But when this same job is run locally with `gitlab-ci-local`, the variable does not get updated, as just seems to set to what ever value it was as if this expression was never run.

#### Authentication

Normal pipelines that are run on GitLab's servers get provided with a `CI_JOB_TOKEN` which can be used to authenticate when pulling submodules that are other private GitLab repositories, or when pulling/pushing to the GitLab container registry. If you want access when running locally, first create a personal access token through the GitLab web interface (with the necessary permissions). Then add it to your `.gitlab-ci-local-variables.yml` file as shown:

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci-local-variables.yml"
---
CI_JOB_TOKEN: <your_personal_access_token>
```

#### Image Registry

If you access the repos image registry (or another GitLab repo's image registry) you will need to set both `CI_JOB_TOKEN` and `CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE` in `.gitlab-ci-local-variables.yml`.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci-local-variables.yml"
---
CI_JOB_TOKEN: <your_personal_access_token>
CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE: <your_registry_image>
```

`CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE` should be in the format `registry.gitlab.com/<namespace>/<project>`, e.g. `registry.gitlab.com/my-group/my-project`. You can copy the registry URL from the GitLab web interface by going to the image registry and copying any one image URL to the clipboard, and then removing the `:tag` from the end of the URL.

### Watch Out For Untracked Files

GCL will not sync local files that are not tracked by Git. So if you are playing around and add a completely new file, you might run into a "file not found" error when running your pipeline. To fix this, all you need to do is run `git add ...` to stage the file in git (it doesn't need to be committed)[^github-repo-gitlab-ci-local].

The file does not need to be continuously re-added to the git staging area when changes are made, as long as the file has been staged (or committed) at least once.

### Caching

`gitlab-ci-local` does not support the GitLab caching feature. `gitlab-ci.yml` statements like:

```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - path/to/cache
```

will not be cached when running the job locally with `gitlab-ci-local`, and so expect things to run slower in this situation.

## GitLab Runners

GitLab runners are the machines/applications that run your CI pipelines. GitLab runners can be configured and run on GitLab's servers (GitLab-hosted runners) or self-hosted on your own servers.

You use tags (GitLab tags, not Git tags) to specify what runner should run a job. GitLab-hosted runners will by default (an untagged job) use the `small` Linux x86-64 runner[^gitlab-gitlab-hosted-runners].

GitLab-hosted runners support Linux, Windows and MacOS. As of November 2024, the Windows and MacOS runners are in beta[^gitlab-gitlab-hosted-runners].

To use a Windows runner, you would use the `saas-windows-medium-amd64` tag as follows:

```yaml
my_windows_job:
  tags:
    - saas-windows-medium-amd64
```

<Aside type="note">
Windows runners are much slower to start than Linux runners.
