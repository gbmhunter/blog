## Container Registries

Each repo can have it's own container registry. You can use this to store Docker images relating to the project.

`CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE` is provided and is the base path for the container registry.

You can log into the repo's container registry inside a pipeline with the command:

```bash
echo $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER $CI_REGISTRY --password-stdin
```

Then you be able to push a built image:

```bash
docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE"
```

You can download images from the GitLab container registry to your local machine by first logging in:

```bash
docker login registry.gitlab.com
```

You will be prompted to enter your username and password. If you have 2FA enabled, you will have to substitute your password with a personal access token.

You can then download and run an image with:

```bash
docker run -it registry.gitlab.com/<org_name>/<project_path> bash
```

## Includes

You can include files in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the `include` keyword. This is useful for sharing common configuration between multiple projects.

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
```

You can also use the `ref` to specify a branch, tag or commit SHA when including a file. This is good for "version control" of your include dependencies.

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    ref: 'main' # Branch name
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    ref: 'v1.0.0' # Tag name
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
  - project: 'my-group/my-project'
    ref: 'b6901dcb0918db67a81b190d24fa67f0b5f99fdb' # Commit SHA
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
```
