## Running Specific Commands

To run a specific bitbake command, use the -c option followed by the command:

```sh
$ bitbake -c compile
```

`-c` can be followed with things such as:

* fetch
* coinfigure
* compile
* package
* clean

To force a bitbake command, use the `-f` option:

```sh
$ bitbake -f -c compile
```

## Debug Output

The `-v` option increases the amount of info that bitbake prints.

```sh  
$ bitbake -v core-image-minimal
```

But you can do better! You can also add the options `-DDD` for even more debug output!

```sh    
$ bitbake -v -DDD core-image-minimal
```
