Embedded Linux is the name given to the Linux operating system when it is run on **resource-constrained systems**, as opposed to traditional laptop, desktop or server style computers.

## Differences With "Standard" Linux

Embedded devices typically have fewer resources and hardware than a traditional computer running Linux. For example, embedded Linux might run on a single-board MCU which does not have a screen, harddrive or speakers. The board will usually have far less ROM and RAM than a traditional computer.

Because of the resource/hardware constraints, the embedded Linux kernel is usually stripped of all unneeded features, resulting in a much smaller ROM/RAM footprint.

## Functionality Of MCUs

A MCU designed to run embedded Linux (or any other high-level operating system) usually has some (or most) of the following features:

* CPU (e.g. a ARM A9)
* MMU (if no MMU is present, a special type of Linux has to be run)
* Memory interface
* Graphics processor
* Ethernet
* USB
* UART interface
* SPI interface
* I2C interface
* CAN interface
* Analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs)
* Timers
* General purpose IO (GPIO)
* Watchdog timer (WDT)
* JTAG

## Development Kits

2 of the most popular embedded Linux development kits are the RaspberryPi and the BeagleBone.

## BusyBox

BusyBox is a bunch of stripped down Linux tools that are compiled into one executable. This makes it a popular choice for embedded devices, as each separate executable on an embedded system requires a significant amount of overhead.

## Embedded ABI

An _embedded application binary interface (EABI)_ is very similar to a normal ABI. It specifies:

* File formats
* Data types
* Register usage
* Stack frame organisation
