LabJack is a company that produces data acquisition systems (DAQs).

## Drivers

LabJack provides drivers for a variety of operating systems and CPU architectures. The following table shows the drivers for each LabJack model, categorized by operating system.[^labjack-exodriver-downloads]

| LabJack Model | Windows | Linux | macOS |
| ------------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| U3, U6, UE9   | UD library | Exodriver | Exodriver |
| U12           | U12 Windows Installer | ljacklm | ljacklm |
| T4, T7        | LJM library | LJM library | LJM library |

`ljacklm` is a higher level library that requires Exodriver.

LabJack also maintains the Python library called [LabJackPython](https://support.labjack.com/docs/labjackpython-for-ud-exodriver-u12-windows-mac-lin). It is cross-platform and runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. It uses the UD and U12 drivers on Windows, and the Exodriver on Linux and macOS. It doesn't support the T4 and T7 which require the LJM library. For that, use the [Python_LJM library](https://support.labjack.com/docs/python-for-ljm-windows-mac-linux).

## LabJack U6

The LabJack U6 has 20 digital I/O. The pins MIO0-MIO2 are multiplexed with the CIO0-CIO2 pins[^labjack-u6-ds-digital-io].

The following bit numbers are used to specify the digital I/O:

```txt
0-7 FIO0-FIO7
8-15 EIO0-EIO7
16-19 CIO0-CIO3
20-22 MIO0-MIO2  (Use 16-18 to operate on these)
```

Using pin numbers 20-22 in the API will not work. Instead, you have to use the corresponding `CIOx` bit numbers 16-18.
