LabJack is a company that produces data acquisition systems (DAQs).

Python is one of the best supported languages to interface to the LabJack devices, followed by C and C++. Python is supported by most devices on most operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux, macOS).

## LabJack U6

The LabJack U6 has 20 digital I/O. The pins MIO0-MIO2 are multiplexed with the CIO0-CIO2 pins[^labjack-u6-ds-digital-io].

The following bit numbers are used to specify the digital I/O:

```txt
0-7 FIO0-FIO7
8-15 EIO0-EIO7
16-19 CIO0-CIO3
20-22 MIO0-MIO2  (Use 16-18 to operate on these)
```

Using pin numbers 20-22 in the API will not work. Instead, you have to use the corresponding `CIOx` bit numbers 16-18.
