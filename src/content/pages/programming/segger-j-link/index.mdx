## Square pylink

`pylink` is a Python library for controlling Segger J-Link devices. It supports:

* SWD
* RTT

You can install it with:

```bash
uv add pylink-square
```

You will also need to install the SEGGER J-Link [Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink). This pack installs SEGGER's C-libraries for interacting with a J-Link. `pylink` contains bindings to call functions in these libraries.

<Aside type="caution">
The package name is called `pylink-square` and not just `pylink` (this is a different library).
