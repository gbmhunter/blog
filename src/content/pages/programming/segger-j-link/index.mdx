## JLink Commander Executable

Installing the SEGGER J-Link [Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) should provide you with a J-Link executable. This is called the "J-Link Commander". On Windows this is named `JLink.exe`, and is typically installed to `C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLink_V<version>\JLink.exe` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLink_V874a\JLink.exe`).

<Aside type="note">
Multiple versions of the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack can be installed on the same machine.
</Aside>

Chip names are how J-Link identifies the connected device. For example, for the nRF9151 MCUs from Nordic Semiconductor, the name is `nRF9151_xxCA`.

## RTOS Awareness

The J-Link has built-in RTOS awareness for the following RTOSs:

- ChibiOS
- embOS
- [FreeRTOS](/programming/operating-systems/freertos/)
- [NuttX](/programming/operating-systems/nuttx/)
- [Zephyr](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/)

Built-in support allows you to see RTOS specific information in the debugger, such as the thread stacks and state.

Files to support these RTOSs can be found in the `GDBServer` sub-directory under the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack installation directory.

## RTT

Real-Time Transfer (RTT) is a feature of the J-Link that allows you to transfer arbitrary data between the host and the target microcontroller over the SWD or JTAG interface. It works by writing data to a special region of memory on the target microcontroller. The J-Link probe can read this data without interrupting the CPU and can be read a high speeds (> 1MHz). It is supported on ARM Cortex-A/R/M, RISC-V and Renesas RX architectures.[^segger-about-real-time-transfer]

RTT supports multiple communication channels in both directions.[^segger-about-real-time-transfer] Each channel can have a direction (up vs. down), buffer size and flags associated with it.

SEGGER provides an RTT client as part of the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack. It is called `JLinkRTTClient.exe` and is typically installed in the installation directory. When you run the client, it connects to an RTT server running at `localhost:19021`. Before running the client, make sure you have started `JLink.exe` and connected to your target device. This will start up the server which the client will connect to.

## Square pylink

`pylink` is a Python library for controlling Segger J-Link devices. It supports:

* SWD
* RTT

You can install it with:

```bash
uv add pylink-square
```

You will also need to install the SEGGER J-Link [Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink). This pack installs SEGGER's C-libraries for interacting with a J-Link. `pylink` contains bindings to call functions in these libraries.

<Aside type="caution">
The package name is called `pylink-square` and not just `pylink` (this is a different library).
</Aside>

## PhinCo/node-jlink

PhinCo/node-jlink is a NodeJS driver for the SEGGER J-Link command line tool jlinkexe.[^github-phinco-node-jlink] You will also need to install the SEGGER J-Link [Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) so that `jlinkexe` is available in your PATH to the driver..
