title: Using Connect
type: page
---

Connect is a middleware framework for node. It contains a body parser, cookie manager, session management, static file server, query string parser, favicon server, and more.

The Express extension uses the Connect extension to provide some of it's functionality.

## Installation

To install Connect, you can use NPM (node package manager) with the following command:

```sh    
$ npm install connect
```

## Static File Server

One of Connects useful features is the ability to easily create a static file server. The most basic file server can be achieved with the following code:

```js    
connect()
    .use(connect.static(__dirname + '/public'))
```

`__dirname` is a special variable which represents the current directory the code file is in.
