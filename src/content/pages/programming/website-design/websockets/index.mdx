A WebSocket is a two-way (full-duplex) communication protocol that uses a TCP connection to transfer the data. It is a commonly used protocol to send data between a web server and a client (webpage) running in a browser on a users computer. Web sockets allowed the server to send data back to the client without the client first requesting it (or polling for it).
