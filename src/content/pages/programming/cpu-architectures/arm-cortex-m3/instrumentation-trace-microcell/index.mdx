<p>The ITM can be used to redirect `printf()` function calls. This allows a `printf()` style debugging capabilities on an embedded platform, which typically doesn't have a standard terminal window for output.</p>

<p>The ITM is part of the Coresight debugging and trace system, shown in the right of the below diagram.</p>

<p><code>printf()</code> ultimately relies on the function <code>fputc()</code> to do the low-level character outputting. So this is the function we are going to replace. The following code shows the re-definition of <code>fputc()</code>.</p>

```c
int fputc(int ch, FILE *f) {
    return ITM_SendChar(ch);
}
```

<p>Note that the passed in file argument <code>f</code> is ignored altogether.</p>

<p><code>ITM_SendChar()</code> is a Cortex-M3 function provided by ARM and is defined in <code>core_cm3.h</code>. The declaration of it is shown below (for reference purposes).</p>

```c
static __INLINE uint32_t ITM_SendChar (uint32_t ch);
```
