An analytic signal is a complex-valued function that has no negative frequency components. It is created by taking the Hilbert transform of a real-valued function and then adding the original function with the imaginary number multiplied by the Hilbert transform.

One way to calculate the analytic signal $s_a(t)$ of a real-valued function $s(t)$ is:

$$
s_a(t) = s(t) + j\ \text{Hilbert}(s(t))
$$

<div className="centered">
  where:<br/>
  $s_a(t)$ is the computed analytic signal<br/>
  $s(t)$ is the original real-valued function<br/>
  $j$ is the imaginary number ($j = \sqrt{-1}$), also seen as $i$ in maths ($j$ is used in electronics as to not get $i$ confused with current)<br/>
  $\text{Hilbert}(s(t))$ is the Hilbert transform of $s(t)$<br/>
</div>

The above equation is in the time domain. You can also calculate the analytic signal in the frequency domain $S_a(f)$ using the following equation:

$$
S_a(f) = 2u(f)S(f)
$$

<div className="centered">
  where:<br/>
  $S_a(f)$ is the computed analytic signal in the frequency domain<br/>
  $S(f)$ is the original real-valued function in the frequency domain<br/>
  $u(f)$ is the Heaviside step function<br/>
</div>

This equation shows that, in the frequency domain, the analytic signal is calculated simply by:

1. Removing all the negative frequency components
2. Doubling the magnitude of the positive frequency components

## Python

The Python library [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) provides the `scipy.signal.hilbert()` function to compute the Hilbert transform of a signal.
