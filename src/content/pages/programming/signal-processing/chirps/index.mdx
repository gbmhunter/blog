A chirp is a signal whose frequency changes over time. Up chirps are signals whose frequency increases over time, and down chirps are signals whose frequency decreases over time. The frequency change can be linear (if the rate of change is not mentioned, it can be assumed to be linear), exponential, or some other function.

The simplest chirp signal can be created by squaring the time variable in a normal sinusoidal signal, for example:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) = \sin(t^2)
\end{align}
$$

Chirp signals are often used in radar and communication systems. The low power RF communication protocol LoRa uses chirp signals (specifically, a proprietary form of chirp spread spectrum in where each symbol has a different starting frequency) to encode information.[^wikipedia-lora]

## Linear Chirps

A linear chirp is a chirp in which the frequency changes linearly over time. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = ct + f_0
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the starting frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$c$ is the rate of change of frequency, in $Hz/s$<br/>
$t$ is the time, in $s$<br/></p>

The phase equation $\phi(t)$ for any oscillating signal is always the integral of the frequency function $f(t)$.

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau \\
          &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t (f_0 + c\tau) d\tau \\
          &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \left( \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

Now that we have the phase equation, we can write the equation for the linear chirp signal as (since $x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))$):

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin(\phi(t)) \\
     &= \sin\left( \phi_0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$
