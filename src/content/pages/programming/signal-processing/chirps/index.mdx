A chirp is a signal whose frequency changes over time. Up chirps are signals whose frequency increases over time, and down chirps are signals whose frequency decreases over time. The frequency change can be linear (if the rate of change is not mentioned, it can be assumed to be linear), exponential, or some other function.

The simplest chirp signal can be created by squaring the time variable in a normal sinusoidal signal, for example:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) = \sin(t^2)
\end{align}
$$

Chirp signals are often used in radar and communication systems due to their favorable properties, such as constant amplitude, good autocorrelation properties, and resistance to Doppler shifts. The low power RF communication protocol LoRa uses chirp signals (specifically, a proprietary form of chirp spread spectrum where each symbol has a different starting frequency) to encode information.[^wikipedia-lora]

## Basic Equations

These basic equations are applicable to most chirp signals including the linear chirps. These equations will be used in the following sections as needed.

A chirp signal $x(t)$ can be described by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$x(t)$ is the chirp signal at time $t$<br/>
$\phi(t)$ is the phase at time $t$, in $rad$<br/></p>

Angular frequency $\omega(t)$ is the rate of change of phase $\phi(t)$. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
\omega(t) = \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}
\end{align}
$$

Rewriting this in terms of $\phi(t)$ gives:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) = \phi_0 + \int_0^t \omega(\tau) d\tau
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\phi_0$ is the initial phase at time $t = 0$, in $rad$ (we need to add this because the definite integral only gives us the change in phase from 0 to $t$, not the absolute phase at time $t$)<br/></p>

<Aside type="note">
What's this new $\tau$ (tau) variable, and how is it different from $t$? $\tau$ is a dummy variable of integration. $t$ is the specific moment in which you want to know $\phi(t)$, while $\tau$ is a placeholder which "sweeps" through all times from $0$ up to $t$ as part of the integration.
</Aside>

And since $\omega(t) = 2\pi f(t)$, we can write:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) = \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau
\end{align}
$$

This equation will be useful to convert from frequency to phase so that we can create the equation for the chirp signal $x(t)$.

## Linear Chirps

A linear chirp is a chirp in which the frequency changes linearly over time. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = ct + f_0
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the starting frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$c$ is the rate of change of frequency, in $Hz/s$<br/>
$t$ is the time, in $s$<br/></p>

The phase equation $\phi(t)$ for any oscillating signal is always the integral of the frequency function $f(t)$.

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t (f_0 + c\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \left( \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

Now that we have the phase equation, we can write the equation for the linear chirp signal as (since $x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))$):

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin(\phi(t)) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( \phi_0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\phi_0$ is the starting phase at time $t = 0$, in $rad$<br/></p>

<Aside type="example">
Let's create a linear chirp with the following parameters:

- Starting frequency: $f_0 = 1\ \text{kHz}$
- Rate of change of frequency: $c = 100\ \text{kHzs}^{-1}$
- Initial phase: $\phi_0 = 0\ \text{rad}$

This would give us the following equation for the signal $x(t)$:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin\left( 0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{100 \text{kHzs}^{-1}}{2}t^2 + 1 \text{kHz} \cdot t \right] \right) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( 2\pi \left[ 50\text{kHzs}^{-1} \cdot t^2 + 1\text{kHz} \cdot t \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$
