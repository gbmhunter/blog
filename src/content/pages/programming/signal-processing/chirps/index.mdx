<WarningIsNotes />

A chirp is a signal whose frequency changes over time. Up chirps are signals whose frequency increases over time, and down chirps are signals whose frequency decreases over time. The frequency change can be linear (if the rate of change is not mentioned, it can be assumed to be linear), exponential, or some other function.

Chirps are present in many natural and man-made systems. Animals such as birds, frogs and whales create audible chirps, and bats use chirps in the ultrasonic range for echolocation. Chirps are also present in music ("glissando").[^patrick-flandrin-time-frequency-and-chirps]

The simplest chirp signal can be created by squaring the time variable in a normal sinusoidal signal, for example:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) = \sin(t^2)
\end{align}
$$

<IRef iref="fig-basic-chirp-signal" /> shows a plot of this basic chirp signal.

Chirp signals are often used in radar and communication systems due to their favourable properties, such as constant amplitude, good autocorrelation properties, and resistance to Doppler shifts. The low power RF communication protocol LoRa uses chirp signals (specifically, a proprietary form of chirp spread spectrum where each symbol has a different starting frequency) to encode information.[^wikipedia-lora]

## Basic Equations

These basic equations are applicable to most chirp signals including the linear chirps. These equations will be used in the following sections as needed.

A chirp signal $x(t)$ can be described by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$x(t)$ is the chirp signal at time $t$<br/>
$\phi(t)$ is the phase at time $t$, in $rad$<br/></p>

Angular frequency $\omega(t)$ is the rate of change of phase $\phi(t)$. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
\omega(t) = \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}
\end{align}
$$

Rewriting this in terms of $\phi(t)$ gives:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) = \phi_0 + \int_0^t \omega(\tau) d\tau
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\phi_0$ is the initial phase at time $t = 0$, in $rad$ (we need to add this because the definite integral only gives us the change in phase from 0 to $t$, not the absolute phase at time $t$)<br/></p>

<Aside type="note">
What's this new $\tau$ (tau) variable, and how is it different from $t$? $\tau$ is a dummy variable of integration. $t$ is the specific moment in which you want to know $\phi(t)$, while $\tau$ is a placeholder which "sweeps" through all times from $0$ up to $t$ as part of the integration.
</Aside>

And since $\omega(t) = 2\pi f(t)$, we can write:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) = \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau
\end{align}
$$

This equation will be useful to convert from frequency to phase so that we can create the equation for the chirp signal $x(t)$.

## Linear Chirps

A linear chirp is a chirp in which the frequency changes linearly over time. Thus:[^wikipedia-chirp]

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = ct + f_0
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the starting frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$c$ is the rate of change of frequency, in $Hz/s$<br/>
$t$ is the time, in $s$<br/></p>

The phase equation $\phi(t)$ for any oscillating signal is always the integral of the frequency function $f(t)$.

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t (f_0 + c\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \left( \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

Now that we have the phase equation, we can write the equation for the linear chirp signal as (since $x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))$):

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin(\phi(t)) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( \phi_0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\phi_0$ is the starting phase at time $t = 0$, in $rad$<br/></p>

<Aside type="example">
Let's create a linear chirp with the following parameters:

- Starting frequency: $f_0 = 1\ \text{kHz}$
- Rate of change of frequency: $c = 100\ \text{kHzs}^{-1}$
- Initial phase: $\phi_0 = 0\ \text{rad}$

This would give us the following equation for the signal $x(t)$:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin\left( 0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{100 \text{kHzs}^{-1}}{2}t^2 + 1 \text{kHz} \cdot t \right] \right) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( 2\pi \left[ 50\text{kHzs}^{-1} \cdot t^2 + 1\text{kHz} \cdot t \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

<IRef iref="fig-linear-chirp-spectrogram" /> shows a spectrogram of the same linear chirp signal. A spectrogram displays how the frequency content of a signal changes over time, with time on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and power spectral density shown as color intensity. The linear increase in frequency over time is clearly visible as a diagonal line from 1 kHz at $t = 0$ to 3 kHz at $t = 20\ \text{ms}$.

The signal was padded at the beginning and end (with an extrapolated chirp signal, not just zeros) to there was no blank areas on the left and right.</Image>

</Aside>

## Exponential Chirps

An exponential chirp (also called a geometric chirp) is a chirp in which the frequency changes exponentially over time. This means for any two points in time $t_1$ and $t_2$ where the time interval $T (\Delta t = t_2 - t_1)$ is kept constant, the frequency ratio $\frac{f(t_2)}{f(t_1)}$ is also kept constant.

<IRef iref="fig-exponential-chirp-signal" /> shows a plot of an exponential chirp signal.

<Image iref="fig-exponential-chirp-signal" src={import('./_assets/exponential-chirp-signal.png')} width="700px">A plot showing an exponential chirp signal. This chirp starts at 1 kHz and exponentially increases to 8 kHz after 20 milliseconds.</Image>

The frequency $f(t)$ of an exponential chirp is given by the following equation:[^wikipedia-chirp]

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = f_0 k^{\frac{t}{T}}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the initial frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$k$ is the frequency ratio, a constant<br/>
$T$ is the time interval between the two points in time, in $s$<br/></p>

The frequency ratio $k$ is given by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
k = \frac{f_1}{f_0}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f_1$ is the frequency at time $t_1$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the initial frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/></p>

We can write the phase equation $\phi(t)$ by integrating the frequency equation:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f_0 k^{\frac{\tau}{T}} d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi f_0 \left[ \frac{T(k^\frac{t}{T} - 1)}{ln(k)} \right]
\end{align}
$$

To get the equation for the exponential chirp signal $x(t)$, we substitute this equation for phase into $x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))$.

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin(\phi(t)) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( \phi_0 + 2\pi f_0 \left[ \frac{T(k^\frac{t}{T} - 1)}{ln(k)} \right] \right)
\end{align}
$$

<Aside type="example">
Let's create an exponential chirp with the following parameters:

- Initial frequency: $f_0 = 1\ \text{kHz}$
- End frequency: $f_1 = 8\ \text{kHz}$ (this gives a frequency ratio $k = \frac{f_1}{f_0} = 8$)
- Time interval: $T = 20\ \text{ms}$
- Initial phase: $\phi_0 = 0\ \text{rad}$

This would give us the following equation for the signal $x(t)$:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin\left( 0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{20\ \text{ms}(8^\frac{t}{20\ \text{ms}} - 1)}{ln(8)} \right] \right) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( 2\pi \left[ \frac{20\ \text{ms}(8^\frac{t}{20\ \text{ms}} - 1)}{ln(8)} \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

If we plot this, we get the waveform shown in <IRef iref="fig-example-exponential-chirp-signal" />.

## Hyperbolic Chirps

Hyperbolic chirps are used in radar and wideband active sonar systems as a way of minimizing degradation of matched filter processing when the source and target are moving with respect to each other.[^aus-department-of-defence-calcs-of-sound-scattering-hyperbolic-chirps] [^wikipedia-chirp]

<Aside type="tip">

A matched filter is when you look for the sent signal in the received signal. You do this by correlating the received signal with the sent signal. You will get a sharp peak in the correlation when the signals correlate, telling you a reflection has been received.

When the target is moving relative to the source, the received signal will be Doppler shifted. This means that the chirp will have:

- All chirp frequencies will be shifted up or down
- The time scale of the chirp will be stretched or compressed

It's this time scale stretching/compressing that messes with the correlation. It will spread out your correlation peak into a smoother "bump", reducing your ability to detect the reflection.

The neat thing about hyperbolic chirps is that when they are Doppler shifted, it still looks like a frequency shifted version of itself because of the unique mathematical properties of the hyperbolic function. This means you can still get excellent matched filter response by just adjusting for frequency shift.

</Aside>

<IRef iref="fig-hyperbolic-chirp-signal" /> shows a plot of a hyperbolic chirp signal.

The frequency $f(t)$ of a hyperbolic chirp is given by the following equation:[^wikipedia-chirp]

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = \frac{f_0 f_1 T}{(f_0 - f_1)t + f_1 T}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the initial frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_1$ is the final frequency at time $t = T$, in $Hz$<br/>
$T$ is the time interval between the two points in time, in $s$<br/></p>

We can integrate the frequency equation to get the phase equation $\phi(t)$:[^wikipedia-chirp]

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t \frac{f_0 f_1 T}{(f_0 - f_1)\tau + f_1 T} d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \frac{-f_0 f_1 T}{f_1 - f_0} \ln \left( 1 - \frac{f_1 - f_0}{f_1 T}t \right)
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\phi(t)$ is the phase at time $t$, in $rad$<br/>
$\phi_0$ is the initial phase at time $t = 0$, in $rad$<br/></p>

To get the equation for the hyperbolic chirp signal $x(t)$, we substitute this equation for phase into $x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))$.

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin(\phi(t)) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( \phi_0 + 2\pi \frac{-f_0 f_1 T}{f_1 - f_0} \ln \left( 1 - \frac{f_1 - f_0}{f_1 T}t \right) \right)
\end{align}
$$

<Aside type="example">

Let's create a hyperbolic chirp with the following parameters:

- Initial frequency: $f_0 = 1\ \text{kHz}$
- End frequency: $f_1 = 8\ \text{kHz}$
- Time interval: $T = 20\ \text{ms}$
- Initial phase: $\phi_0 = 0\ \text{rad}$

This would give us the following equation for the signal $x(t)$:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin\left( 0 + 2\pi \frac{-1\ \text{kHz} \cdot 8\ \text{kHz} \cdot 20\ \text{ms}}{8\ \text{kHz} - 1\ \text{kHz}} \ln \left( 1 - \frac{8\ \text{kHz} - 1\ \text{kHz}}{8\ \text{kHz} \cdot 20\ \text{ms}}t \right) \right) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( -143.62 \ln (1 - 43.75 t) \right)
\end{align}
$$

If we plot this, we get the waveform shown in <IRef iref="fig-example-hyperbolic-chirp-signal" />.

The signal was padded with extrapolated values at the start, but with zeroes at the end due to the inability to calculate $\ln$ for negative numbers.</Image>

### Doppler Tolerance and Matched Filter Performance

One of the most important properties of hyperbolic chirps is their **Doppler tolerance**. In radar and sonar systems, when a signal reflects off a moving target, the received signal undergoes a Doppler shift. This shift not only changes the frequency content but also compresses or stretches the signal in time.

Mathematically, if the transmitted signal is $s(t)$, the received signal from a moving target is:

$$
\begin{align}
r(t) = s(\alpha t)
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\alpha$ is the time-scaling factor due to Doppler effect<br/></p>

For a two-way propagation system (a.k.a. pulse-echo -- like active sonar or radar), the time-scaling factor $\alpha$ is given by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha = 1 + \frac{2v}{c}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\alpha$ is the time-scaling factor due to Doppler effect<br/>
$v$ is the relative velocity between source and target, in $m/s$<br/>
$c$ is the speed of wave propagation (speed of light for radar, speed of sound for sonar), in $m/s$<br/></p>

The factor of 2 in the above equation comes from the fact it is a round-trip (the signal gets distorted on the way out and back).

<Aside type="note">
The Doppler effect is much more significant in sonar than radar because sound travels ~200,000x slower than light in air. A 37 m/s target produces $\alpha \approx 1.05$ in sonar but only $\alpha \approx 1.00000025$ in radar.
</Aside>

A **matched filter** is a signal processing technique where the received signal is correlated with a copy of the transmitted signal to detect the presence and timing of echoes. The output produces a sharp peak when the signals align, indicating a detection.

The key problem is that when the received signal is time-scaled by $\alpha$, it no longer perfectly matches the template signal. For linear chirps, this mismatch causes the matched filter output to:
- Reduce in peak amplitude (harder to detect)
- Spread out in time (reduced range resolution)

Hyperbolic chirps have a special property: when time-scaled, they remain hyperbolic chirps (just with different effective parameters). This means the Doppler-shifted signal still correlates well with the original, maintaining a sharp peak in the matched filter output.

<IRef iref="fig-doppler-matched-filter-comparison" /> shows a side-by-side comparison of matched filter outputs for linear and hyperbolic chirps, both with and without Doppler shift ($\alpha = 1.05$, representing approximately 5% time compression). The negative time lag for the peaks in the doppler shifted waveforms is due to the signal being compressed in time -- the received signal "finishes early" and the correlation maximum shift to where the compressed signal best aligns with the original.

<Image iref="fig-doppler-matched-filter-comparison" src={import('./_assets/doppler-matched-filter-comparison.png')} width="900px">Side-by-side comparison of matched filter outputs for linear (left) and hyperbolic (right) chirps. The blue solid line shows the ideal case with no Doppler shift, while the red dashed line shows the response when the received signal is Doppler-shifted by $\alpha = 1.05$. Notice how the linear chirp's peak is significantly reduced and broadened, while the hyperbolic chirp maintains a much sharper peak.</Image>

<IRef iref="fig-doppler-tolerance-overlay" /> provides a direct overlay comparison of just the Doppler-shifted responses, making the difference even clearer. The linear chirps correlation peak only hits a peak normalized correlation value of 0.31, whilst the hyperbolic chirp hits a peak of 0.88!
