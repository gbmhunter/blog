A chirp is a signal whose frequency changes over time. Up chirps are signals whose frequency increases over time, and down chirps are signals whose frequency decreases over time. The frequency change can be linear (if the rate of change is not mentioned, it can be assumed to be linear), exponential, or some other function.

Chirps are present in many natural and man-made systems. Animals such as birds, frogs and whales create audible chirps, and bats use chirps in the ultrasonic range for echolocation. Chirps are also present in music ("glissando").[^patrick-flandrin-time-frequency-and-chirps]

The simplest chirp signal can be created by squaring the time variable in a normal sinusoidal signal, for example:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) = \sin(t^2)
\end{align}
$$

Chirp signals are often used in radar and communication systems due to their favourable properties, such as constant amplitude, good autocorrelation properties, and resistance to Doppler shifts. The low power RF communication protocol LoRa uses chirp signals (specifically, a proprietary form of chirp spread spectrum where each symbol has a different starting frequency) to encode information.[^wikipedia-lora]

## Basic Equations

These basic equations are applicable to most chirp signals including the linear chirps. These equations will be used in the following sections as needed.

A chirp signal $x(t)$ can be described by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$x(t)$ is the chirp signal at time $t$<br/>
$\phi(t)$ is the phase at time $t$, in $rad$<br/></p>

Angular frequency $\omega(t)$ is the rate of change of phase $\phi(t)$. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
\omega(t) = \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}
\end{align}
$$

Rewriting this in terms of $\phi(t)$ gives:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) = \phi_0 + \int_0^t \omega(\tau) d\tau
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\phi_0$ is the initial phase at time $t = 0$, in $rad$ (we need to add this because the definite integral only gives us the change in phase from 0 to $t$, not the absolute phase at time $t$)<br/></p>

<Aside type="note">
What's this new $\tau$ (tau) variable, and how is it different from $t$? $\tau$ is a dummy variable of integration. $t$ is the specific moment in which you want to know $\phi(t)$, while $\tau$ is a placeholder which "sweeps" through all times from $0$ up to $t$ as part of the integration.
</Aside>

And since $\omega(t) = 2\pi f(t)$, we can write:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) = \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau
\end{align}
$$

This equation will be useful to convert from frequency to phase so that we can create the equation for the chirp signal $x(t)$.

## Linear Chirps

A linear chirp is a chirp in which the frequency changes linearly over time. Thus:[^wikipedia-chirp]

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = ct + f_0
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the starting frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$c$ is the rate of change of frequency, in $Hz/s$<br/>
$t$ is the time, in $s$<br/></p>

The phase equation $\phi(t)$ for any oscillating signal is always the integral of the frequency function $f(t)$.

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t (f_0 + c\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \left( \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

Now that we have the phase equation, we can write the equation for the linear chirp signal as (since $x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))$):

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin(\phi(t)) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( \phi_0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{c}{2}t^2 + f_0t \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$\phi_0$ is the starting phase at time $t = 0$, in $rad$<br/></p>

<Aside type="example">
Let's create a linear chirp with the following parameters:

- Starting frequency: $f_0 = 1\ \text{kHz}$
- Rate of change of frequency: $c = 100\ \text{kHzs}^{-1}$
- Initial phase: $\phi_0 = 0\ \text{rad}$

This would give us the following equation for the signal $x(t)$:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin\left( 0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{100 \text{kHzs}^{-1}}{2}t^2 + 1 \text{kHz} \cdot t \right] \right) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( 2\pi \left[ 50\text{kHzs}^{-1} \cdot t^2 + 1\text{kHz} \cdot t \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

<IRef iref="fig-linear-chirp-spectrogram" /> shows a spectrogram of the same linear chirp signal. A spectrogram displays how the frequency content of a signal changes over time, with time on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and power spectral density shown as color intensity. The linear increase in frequency over time is clearly visible as a diagonal line from 1 kHz at $t = 0$ to 3 kHz at $t = 20\ \text{ms}$.

## Exponential Chirps

An exponential chirp (also called a geometric chirp) is a chirp in which the frequency changes exponentially over time. This means for any two points in time $t_1$ and $t_2$ where the time interval $T (\Delta t = t_2 - t_1)$ is kept constant, the frequency ratio $\frac{f(t_2)}{f(t_1)}$ is also kept constant.

<IRef iref="fig-exponential-chirp-signal" /> shows a plot of an exponential chirp signal.

<Image iref="fig-exponential-chirp-signal" src={import('./_assets/exponential-chirp-signal.png')} width="700px">A plot showing an exponential chirp signal. This chirp starts at 1 kHz and exponentially increases to 8 kHz after 20 milliseconds.</Image>

The frequency $f(t)$ of an exponential chirp is given by the following equation:[^wikipedia-chirp]

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = f_0 k^{\frac{t}{T}}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the initial frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$k$ is the frequency ratio, a constant<br/>
$T$ is the time interval between the two points in time, in $s$<br/></p>

The frequency ratio $k$ is given by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
k = \frac{f_1}{f_0}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f_1$ is the frequency at time $t_1$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the initial frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/></p>

We can write the phase equation $\phi(t)$ by integrating the frequency equation:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(t) &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f_0 k^{\frac{\tau}{T}} d\tau \nonumber \\
        &= \phi_0 + 2\pi f_0 \left[ \frac{T(k^\frac{t}{T} - 1)}{ln(k)} \right]
\end{align}
$$

To get the equation for the exponential chirp signal $x(t)$, we substitute this equation for phase into $x(t) = \sin(\phi(t))$.

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin(\phi(t)) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( \phi_0 + 2\pi f_0 \left[ \frac{T(k^\frac{t}{T} - 1)}{ln(k)} \right] \right)
\end{align}
$$

<Aside type="example">
Let's create an exponential chirp with the following parameters:

- Initial frequency: $f_0 = 1\ \text{kHz}$
- End frequency: $f_1 = 8\ \text{kHz}$ (this gives a frequency ratio $k = \frac{f_1}{f_0} = 8$)
- Time interval: $T = 20\ \text{ms}$
- Initial phase: $\phi_0 = 0\ \text{rad}$

This would give us the following equation for the signal $x(t)$:

$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \sin\left( 0 + 2\pi \left[ \frac{20\ \text{ms}(8^\frac{t}{20\ \text{ms}} - 1)}{ln(8)} \right] \right) \nonumber \\
     &= \sin\left( 2\pi \left[ \frac{20\ \text{ms}(8^\frac{t}{20\ \text{ms}} - 1)}{ln(8)} \right] \right) \\
\end{align}
$$

If we plot this, we get the waveform shown in <IRef iref="fig-example-exponential-chirp-signal" />.

## Hyperbolic Chirps

Hyperbolic chirps are used in radar and wideband active sonar systems as a way of minimizing degradation of matched filter processing when the source and target are moving with respect to each other.[^aus-department-of-defence-calcs-of-sound-scattering-hyperbolic-chirps] [^wikipedia-chirp]

The frequency $f(t)$ of a hyperbolic chirp is given by the following equation:[^wikipedia-chirp]

$$
\begin{align}
f(t) = \frac{f_0 f_1 T}{(f_0 - f_1)t + f_1 T}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$f(t)$ is the frequency at time $t$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_0$ is the initial frequency at time $t = 0$, in $Hz$<br/>
$f_1$ is the final frequency at time $t = T$, in $Hz$<br/>
$T$ is the time interval between the two points in time, in $s$<br/></p>
