<WarningIsNotes />

ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power SoC microcontrollers designed by [Espressif Systems](/programming/microcontrollers/espressif/).

The ESP32 range is supported by the ESP-IDF framework.

## ESP-IDF

ESP-IDF provides a [FreeRTOS](/programming/operating-systems/freertos/) port that supports both the Xtensa and RISC-V architectures used by ESP SoCs. ESP-IDF provides different versions of FreeRTOS in order to support SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) on 2-core ESP SoCs. There is also the option of using the Amazon SMP FreeRTOS which supports any number of cores[^espressif-esp-idf-freertos]. ESP-IDF uses [CMake](/programming/build-systems-and-package-managers/cmake/) as it's build system.

ESP-IDF supports dev containers. There is a [Docker image pushed to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/idf) that can be used for both dev containers and CI/CD pipelines. It contains ESP-IDF plus all of the additional tools required to build a ESP-IDF based project[^dockerhub-espressif-idf]. It is tagged with the ESP-IDF version.

### Post-built Commands

To add a post-build command to a CMake-based ESP-IDF project, you can use the `add_custom_command()` function, targeting the `gen_project_binary` target and with the `POST_BUILD` argument. This function allows you to specify a shell command that should be executed after the build process has completed.

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
add_custom_command(
    TARGET gen_project_binary
    POST_BUILD
    COMMAND echo "My custom command that runs after the project binary has been built."
)
```

Be aware that the shell command may make the project platform dependent. You could couple this with `if(CMAKE_HOST_WIN32)` style conditionals to run OS specific commands. You can see where the target `gen_project_binary` is defined in the ESP-IDF code [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/v5.3.1/components/esptool_py/project_include.cmake#L146). `app` is another valid target you could use to run commands on.
