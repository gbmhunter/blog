<WarningIsNotes />

ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power SoC microcontrollers designed by [Espressif Systems](/programming/microcontrollers/espressif/).

The ESP32 range is supported by the ESP-IDF framework.

## ESP-IDF

ESP-IDF provides a FreeRTOS port that supports both the Xtensa and RISC-V architectures used by ESP SoCs. ESP-IDF provides different versions of FreeRTOS in order to support SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) on 2-core ESP SoCs. There is also the option of using the Amazon SMP FreeRTOS which supports any number of cores[^espressif-esp-idf-freertos].

ESP-IDF supports dev containers.
