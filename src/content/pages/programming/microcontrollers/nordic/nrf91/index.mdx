<WarningIsNotes />

The _nRF91 Series_ is a family of wireless SiPs (system-in-packages) by Nordic Semiconductor that feature an integrated low-power LTE-M/NB-IoT modem and GNSS. They include a 64MHz Arm Cortex-M33 CPU dedicated for application processing (the modem has its own CPU).

The following SiPs are available in this series:

* nRF9131
* nRF9151
* nRF9160
* nRF9161

All SiPs in this family come with 1MB of NVM and 256kB of RAM.

The Nordic Thingy:91 X (shown in <IRef iref="fig-nordic-thingy-91-x-case-and-pcb-photo" />) is a development kit that features the nRF9151 SiP (which provides cellular connectivity). It also has a nRF5340 SoC for USB and Bluetooth LED, and a nRF7002 companion IC for WiFi.[^cnx-software-nordic-thingy-91-x]

The nRF91 series has good support for using the [Zephyr framework](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/) to develop the firmware, as is officially backed by Nordic Semiconductor. Zephyr provides a RTOS, peripheral drivers and utility API. There are many project examples and guides available for using Zephyr with the nRF91.

## AT Commands

The nRF91 SiP modems support AT commands for configuration and control.

### Identification

There are a number of commands that can be used to identify the manufacturer, model, revision, e.t.c of the modem. Some are standard AT commands (using `+`) and others are proprietary (using `%`).

Use `AT+CGMI` to get the manufacturer (Manufacturer Identification).

```bash
AT+CGMI
Nordic Semiconductor ASA
OK
```

Use `AT+CGMM` to get the model (Modem Model).

```bash
AT+CGMM
nRF9151-LACA
OK
```

Use `AT+CGMR` to get the revision (Modem Revision).

```bash
AT+CGMR
mfw_nrf91x1_2.0.2
OK
```

Use `AT%SHORTSWVER` to get the short software identification:

```bash
AT%SHORTSWVER
%SHORTSWVER: nrf91x1_2.0.2
OK
```

Use `AT%HWVERSION` to get the hardware version:

```bash
AT%HWVERSION
%HWVERSION: nRF9151 LACA A0A
OK
```

Official documentation for these commands can be found [here](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ref_at_commands/page/REF/at_commands/general/general.html).


### Credentials

`AT%CMNG` (credential management) is used to manage the credentials used by the modem. This includes reading and writing keys and certificates. `AT%CMNG=1` can be used to list all available credentials.

Tags are used to group related credentials together. The idea is that you store related credentials (e.g. root certificate, device certificate, and device private key) under the same tag. The default tag for nRF Cloud credentials is `16842753`. Under each tag another number called the type is used to identify the type of credential.

Note that when managing credentials, the modem must be in the offline state (otherwise the modem will not accept the commands and you will get back an ERROR response).[^nordic-semi-managing-modem-credentials] To set the modem in the offline state, use:

```text
AT+CFUN=4
```

To check if the modem is in the offline state, use `AT+CFUN?`.

#### Listing Credentials

Run `AT%CMNG=1` to list all credentials. You should see output like that shown below:

```txt
mosh:~$ AT%CMNG=1
%CMNG: 1001,0,"5D550643B6400D4341550A9B14AEDD0B4FAC33AE5DEB7D8247B6B4F799C13306"
%CMNG: 1002,0,"2C43952EE9E000FF2ACC4E2ED0897C0A72AD5FA72C3D934E81741CBD54F05BD1"
%CMNG: 1003,0,"39FDCF28AEFFE08D03251FCCAF645E3C5DE19FA4EBBAFC89B4EDE2A422148BAB"
%CMNG: 4294967292,11,"672E2F05962B4EFBFA8801255D87E0E0418F2DDF4DDAEFC59E9B4162F512CB63"
%CMNG: 4294967293,10,"2C43952EE9E000FF2ACC4E2ED0897C0A72AD5FA72C3D934E81741CBD54F05BD1"
%CMNG: 4294967294,6,"409D1FEC20D53135CF03DEA2073B77EB94ED1B28566EC912D161FC5A5B265746"
OK
```

The output format shows the tag, type, and certificate hash (in that order).

#### Writing Credentials

To write a certificate, use `AT%CMNG=0,<sec_tag>,<type>,"<certificate>"`.

`<type>` is the type of credential to write. The following types are supported:

* `0` - Root CA certificate
* `1` - Device certificate
* `2` - Device private key

`<certificate>` is the certificate from a `.pem` file, enclosed in quotes. Within the quotes, new lines are supported, are are not interpreted as the "end of command" as they usually would. This means to can paste the literal contents of the file into the command.

For example, to write a root CA certificate to tag `16842753`, run:

```bash
AT%CMNG=0,16842753,0,"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

```

#### Deleting Credentials

Run `AT%CMNG=3,<tag>,<type>` to delete a credential. For example, to delete device certificate (`<type>` = `1`) stored at tag `16842753`, run:

```bash
AT%CMNG=3,16842753,1
OK
```

The command will return `ERROR` if not certificate existed at the location or if it cannot be deleted. Certificate and key files in `.pem` format usually contain around 1000-2000 characters (the root certificate I was looking at was 1300 or so).

<Aside type="tip">
You don't need to delete a certificate before writing a new one, the modem supports overwriting.
</Aside>

## Starting the Modem

To initialize the modem library and turn on the modem, use:

```c
int err = nrf_modem_lib_init();
__ASSERT(err == 0, "Failed to initialize modem.");
```

Nordic documentation for this function can be found [here](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-apis-latest/page/group_nrf_modem_lib_ga3a5bb46f3fa920cedbeacd4a1189ac41.html).

You can use `AT_MONITOR()` to listen for AT commands from the modem.

```c
AT_MONITOR(mosh_at_cmd_mode_handler, ANY, at_cmd_mode_event_handler, PAUSED);
```

### AT Shell Commands

You can enable AT shell commands with:

```c title="prj.conf"
CONFIG_AT_SHELL
```

However, this does not provide the `at_cmd_mode` command. To get this, you manually have to add it. The best way is to copy the model_shell sample project and modify it.

## Modem Firmware

The modem firmware for the nRF91 SiP is a separate binary to the application firmware. The modem firmware can be downloaded from [here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF9151/Download).

## nRF9151-DK Getting Started Guide

Install the nRF Connect for VS Code extension to VS Code.

Install the most recent SDK and toolchain. As of Feb 2025, these were both at version `v2.9.0`.

From with the nRF Connect extension, click "Create a new application" and then click "Copy a sample" as shown in <IRef iref="fig-nrf-connect-vs-code-create-new-application-from-sample" />.

<Image iref="fig-nrf-connect-vs-code-create-new-application-from-sample" src={import('./_assets/nrf-connect-vs-code-create-new-application-from-sample.webp')} width="600px">Screenshot showing the "Create New Application -> Copy a sample" dialog in the nRF Connect extension for VS Code.</Image>

Then select the SDK you just downloaded as the SDK to select the sample from. Then search and click on the "modem_shell Sample". This should bootstrap you into a new project. You should see a directory structure like that shown in <IRef iref="fig-modem-shell-project-files-vs-code" />. We choose the "modem_shell" sample as it provides useful AT commands through the [Zephyr shell](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/#the-zephyr-shell).

<Image iref="fig-modem-shell-project-files-vs-code" src={import('./_assets/modem-shell-project-files-vs-code.webp')} width="500px">Screenshot showing the files in the modem_shell sample project in VS Code.</Image>

Now you need to add a build configuration before you can build it.

<Image iref="fig-modem-shell-add-build-configuration" src={import('./_assets/modem-shell-add-build-configuration.webp')} width="600px">Screenshot showing where the "Add build configuration" button is in the nRF Connect extension for VS Code.</Image>

The only thing you need to change on the "Build configuration" page is the board. Select the appropriate dev. kit as shown in <IRef iref="fig-modem-shell-build-configuration" />.

<Image iref="fig-modem-shell-build-configuration" src={import('./_assets/modem-shell-build-configuration.webp')} width="600px">Screenshot showing the build configuration for the modem_shell sample project.</Image>

Then hit the big blue "Build Configuration" button at the bottom. All going well, your project should build successfully. Connect your dev. kit to your computer via USB, and then you should be able to program the dev. kit with this firmware. Also, make sure to connect a terminal to the dev. kits other serial port that should be enumerated when the cable is plugged in (one is used for programming, the other as the serial console). All going well, you should see output like that shown in <IRef iref="fig-modem-shell-output-in-ninjaterm" /> (captured in [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/)).

<Image iref="fig-modem-shell-output-in-ninjaterm" src={import('./_assets/modem-shell-output-in-ninjaterm.webp')} width="600px">Screenshot showing the output of the modem_shell sample project in NinjaTerm.</Image>

The model shell example includes the command `at` to forward commands to the modem. There is also an "AT command mode" so that you can send AT commands directly without having to prefix them with `at`. To enter AT command mode, type `at at_cmd_mode start` as shown in <IRef iref="fig-at-command-mode-from-terminal" />. Press `Ctrl-x, Ctrl-q` to exit AT command mode.

<Image iref="fig-at-command-mode-from-terminal" src={import('./_assets/at-command-mode-from-terminal.webp')} width="600px">Screenshot showing AT command mode being entered from the terminal.</Image>

<Aside type="tip">
If you type commands while in AT command mode and get no response, it might be because your terminal is not sending the write line endings. You can configure the line ending on the firmware side by using the command `at at_cmd_mode <term_cr_lf|term_lf|term_cr>` (or change the line endings in the terminal, if it supports that).

For example, I had to set it to `at at_cmd_mode term_lf` to get the modem to respond to commands with my terminal..
</Aside>

Using the command `west flash --runner jlink` to program the nRF9151 on Linux (on WSL) using JLink v7.94i would cause the pop-up shown in <IRef iref="fig-j-link-unknown-device-nrf9151-pop-up" /> to appear (presumably JLink v7.94i was not new enough to support the nRF9151).

<Image iref="fig-j-link-unknown-device-nrf9151-pop-up" src={import('./_assets/j-link-unknown-device-nrf9151-pop-up.webp')} width="700px" />

If this happens, and you know that there is a recognized device which will work, you can click OK and a modal will show in which you can select the device. This gets old fast though when programming the SoC during development. Instead, you can specify the SoC with the `--device` option. In the above example, I knew pretending to be the `nRF9160` worked ok, so I could use:

```bash
west flash --runner jlink --device nrf9160
```
