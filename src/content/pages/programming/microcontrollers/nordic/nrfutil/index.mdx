## Source Code

It doesn't appear that the up-to-date source code of nRF Util is available. The older repo (`pc-nrfutil`) at https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil was deprecated and marked as archived in Jan 2023.[^nordic-semi-pc-nrfutil-repo]

## Installing Sub-Commands

By default, only a basic subset of the total available nRF Util commands are installed. You can install additional commands based on your specific needs via the `nrfutil install` command. You can use `nrfutil search` to search for installable commands.

For example:

```batch
$ nrfutil search 91
Command Installed Latest Status
91                0.5.0  Not installed
```

Then to install the `91` command, run:

```batch
$ nrfutil install 91
```

## Device Sub-Commands

The nRF Util device sub-command can list, program, recover, erase, and do various operations on Nordic devices. It supports MCUboot and J-Link. Install `device` with:

```batch
$ nrfutil install device
```
