nRF Cloud is a cloud service provided by Nordic Semiconductor that allows you manage your nRF devices.

## History

Nordic Semiconductor acquired a competing cloud management service called [Memfault](/programming/firmware/memfault/) in June 2025.[^nordic-semi-memfault-acquisition] Since then, it appears that parts of Memfault have been integrated into nRF Cloud.

## Secure Identity

Every nRF91x1 device has a unique private key written to during Nordics SoC manufacturing process. Nordic Semiconductor stores the public key in it's nRF Cloud Identity Service database. This private key can never be read or changed for the entire lifetime of the device (even a complete erase will not touch it). It provides a useful way of securely identifying the device to other systems such as cloud platforms using the ECDSA signature scheme. The SoC can use the private key to sign a message that is verified by the cloud.[^nordic-semi-nrf-cloud-identity-service]

nRF91x1 devices and use the private identity key to sign JWT (JSON Web Tokens) when connecting to cloud services.
