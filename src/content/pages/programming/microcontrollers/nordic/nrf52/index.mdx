The _nRF52 Series_ is a family of SoCs by [Nordic Semiconductor](/programming/microcontrollers/nordic/). Two of their core features are [Bluetooth](/electronics/communication-protocols/bluetooth/) and low-energy operation. They feature a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 CPU.

The nRF52 series supports the following wireless protocols with it's RF radio:[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-product-page]

* [Bluetooth 5.4](/electronics/communication-protocols/bluetooth/)
* Bluetooth LE
* Bluetooth mesh
* Thread 
* Zigbee
* 802.15.4
* ANT
* 2.4GHz proprietary protocols

The nRF52840 is likely the most popular MCU in the series and is the most advanced variant in terms of features.[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-product-page] It has a 64MHz Cortex-M4 CPU with FPU, 1MB flash and 256kB RAM.

The nRF52 series has good support for using the [Zephyr framework](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/) to develop the firmware, as is officially backed by Nordic Semiconductor. Zephyr provides a RTOS, peripheral drivers and utility API. There are many project examples and guides available for using Zephyr with the nRF52.

### GPIO Drive Strength

The GPIO pins can be configured in two different drive strengths, standard drive and high drive. <IRef iref="tbl-nrf52-gpio-pin-current-limits" /> shows the current limits for the GPIO pins when configured in standard drive and high drive. The current limits depend on the supply voltage and are also characterized for different output levels (e.g. 0.4 V is considered the max. for a logic low).

When using the [Zephyr framework](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/) for writing firmware, Zephyr provides nRF specific GPIO flags for controlling the drive strength. The drive strength is individually configurable for both a logic low and a logic high output. This is done with the following macros, which set the upper 8 bits of the `gpio_dt_flags_t` struct:[^zephyr-docs-nrf-specific-gpio-flags]

* `NRF_GPIO_DRIVE_S0`: Logic low, standard drive
* `NRF_GPIO_DRIVE_H0`: Logic low, high drive
* `NRF_GPIO_DRIVE_S1`: Logic high, standard drive
* `NRF_GPIO_DRIVE_H1`: Logic high, high drive

These flags are defined in the Zephyr repo under `zephyr/include/zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/nordic-nrf-gpio.h`. For example, the following code is used to configure a GPIO pin with high drive in both directions using the `gpio_pin_configure_dt()` function:

```c
#include <zephyr/drivers/gpio.h>
#include <zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/nordic-nrf-gpio.h> // Needed for the NRF_GPIO_DRIVE_H0H1 macro

// Update the PATH according to your .dts file(s)
const struct gpio_dt_spec l_myGpio = GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(DT_PATH(outputs, myGpio), gpios);

int main() {
    // Configure the GPIO pin as output, defaulting to low, with high drive in both directions. Other flags can be ORed in here too as needed.
    int intRc = gpio_pin_configure_dt(&l_myGpio, GPIO_OUTPUT_INACTIVE | NRF_GPIO_DRIVE_H0H1);
    __ASSERT_NO_MSG(intRc == 0);
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
You can alternatively configure the drive strength in the `.dts` file directly. But I am not a fan the Zephyr device tree and prefer to keep as much of the configuration in the C/C++ code instead.

### Use the NFC Pins

By default, you won't be able to use the two NFC pins (`NFC1` and `NFC2`) on the MCU as GPIOs. To allow them to be used as GPIOs, add `nfct-pins-as-gpios` to your `.dts` file as shown:

```text
&uicr {
    nfct-pins-as-gpios;
};
```

`&uicr` might already be present in your `dts` file with `nfct-pins-as-gpios;` applied. The old way of overriding the default NFC behaviour adding the Kconfig value `CONFIG_NFCT_PINS_AS_GPIOS=y` to your `prj.conf`. However this is now deprecated.

## Successive Approximation ADC (SAADC)

The nRF52 series MCUs have a 12-bit successive approximation [ADC](/electronics/components/analogue-to-digital-converters-adcs/) peripheral called `SAADC`. This peripheral can be used to convert analogue voltages on the `AIN0-AIN7` pins to digital values. It can be used in single ended mode or differential mode. <IRef iref="fig-saadc-internal-block-diagram-nrf52" /> shows the internal block diagram of the SAADC peripheral.

<Image iref="fig-saadc-internal-block-diagram-nrf52" src={import('./_assets/saadc-internal-block-diagram-nrf52.webp')} width="800px">The internal block diagram of the SAADC peripheral on the nRF52 series MCU.[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]</Image>

The accumulator in the SAADC can be to find the average of multiple samples (oversampling). This is used to improve the SNR of the data. Oversampling can be configured with the `OVERSAMPLE` register. `2^OVERSAMPLE` samples are averaged together before one result is written to memory. The `DONE` event is triggered for each input sample, and the `RESULTDONE` event is triggered once per averaged sample written to memory.

<Aside type="tip">
Oversampling does not improve over sources of error, such as integral non-linearity (INL) or differential non-linearity (DNL).[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]
</Aside>

`SAADC` uses EasyDMA to write conversion results to RAM memory.

The `SAADC` peripheral cannot generate events when the converted value crosses a threshold. If you need this functionality, look at using the comparator peripheral (`COMP`) instead. The same analog input pin cannot be used for both `SAADC` and `COMP` peripherals at the same time.

Zephyr's ADC driver can work with the SAADC peripheral. However, only basic functionality is provided by the Zephyr ADC API. For example, the Zephyr ADC API does not allow you to setup repeated sampling based on a timer connected with the DPPI/PPI. If you want more functionality than what the Zephyr ADC API provides, you can use the lower level [nrfx SAADC driver](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/peripherals/#nrfx-saadc-driver).

## Comparator (COMP)

The nRF52 series MCUs have a comparator peripheral called `COMP`. Much like [discrete analogue comparator ICs](/electronics/components/comparators/), this peripheral can be used to compare one input voltage (`VIN+`) against another input voltage (`VIN-`), and can generate events (e.g. raise an interrupt) depending on the result (whether it is higher or lower than the other). `VIN+` can be any of the analog input pins `AIN0-AIN7`. `VIN-` can be any of the analog input pins (differential mode) or from `VREF`, which in turn can be derived from `VDD`, `AIN0-AIN7`, or internal 1.2V, 1.8V or 2.4V references. It's internal block diagram is shown in <IRef iref="fig-comparator-diagram-nrf52" />.

<Image iref="fig-comparator-diagram-nrf52" src={import('./_assets/comparator-diagram-nrf52.webp')} width="600px">The internal architecture of the comparator peripheral on the nRF52 series MCU.[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]</Image>

Events can be generated from:[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]

* `UP` on `VIN-` > `VIN+`
* `DOWN` on `VIN-` < `VIN+`
* `CROSS` on `VIN-` crossing `VIN+`
* `READY` event when core and internal reference are ready.

These built-in events make comparator great for simple analogue change detection. The ADC peripheral (`SAADC`) does not have these events, so if using an ADC instead you would need to continuously poll the ADC result and compare it using CPU time (which would both be higher power and a potential waste of CPU processing time).

The comparator peripheral has configurable hysteresis to prevent false events due to noise on the inputs. In differential mode, the hysteresis is set through the `HYST` register and can either be set to disabled or a fixed 50mV. In single ended mode, hysteresis can be set using `VUP` and `VDOWN` thresholds. The up and down thresholds in single ended mode offer much more flexibility than the `HYST` register available in differential mode.

The comparator peripheral have different speed modes, which also determine the power consumption. The speed modes are set using the `MODE` register. The different modes are:

* Low-power mode
* Normal mode
* High-speed mode

## Near Field Communication Tag (NFCT)

The nRF52 series MCUs have a near field communication ([NFC](/electronics/communication-protocols/near-field-communication/)) tag peripheral called `NFCT`. This peripheral can be used to implement an NFC tag. It supports NFC-A listen mode operation at 13.56MHz and a bitrate of 106kbps.[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]

<IRef iref="fig-nrf52-nfct-peripheral-block-diagram" /> shows the internal block diagram of the NFCT peripheral.

<Image iref="fig-nrf52-nfct-peripheral-block-diagram" src={import('./_assets/nrf52-nfct-peripheral-block-diagram.webp')} width="600px">The internal block diagram of the NFCT peripheral on the nRF52 series MCU.[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]</Image>

The NFCT peripheral uses EasyDMA for the reading and writing of data packets to and from RAM.

As of May 2025, Nordic has the following firmware code examples relating to NRC:[^nordic-semi-nrf-connect-sdk-nfc-samples]

* **NFC - Launch App**: Launches an app on a polling smartphone.
* **NFC - Text record**: Exposes a text record to polling devices.
* **NFC - Shell**: Runs the shell interface with the NFC T4T ISO-DEP transport layer. It uses the NFC shell transport library.
* **NFC - System OFF**: Wakes the MCU up from System OFF mode when it detects an NFC field.
* **NFC - Tag reader**: Makes the MCU a tag reader which can interact with a NFC-A tag.
* **NFC - TNEP poller**: Uses the TNEP for polling device library to exchange data using an NFC polling device.
* **NFC - TNEP tag**: Uses the TNEP for tag device library to exchange data using NFC's TNEP Protocol on an NFC Tag device.
* **NFC - Writable NDEF message**: Exposes an NDEF message that can be overwritten with any other NDEF message by an NFC device.

## Internal RC Oscillator

To enable the internal RC oscillator, add the following to your `prj.conf` file:

```text
CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_RC=y
```

By default, `CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_RC_CALIBRATION=y` is set which means the calibration parameters will be used to make the RC oscillator more accurate.

## Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI)

The QSPI peripheral is designed to communicate with external SPI flash memory ICs. It supports single, dual and quad lane SPI buses with a 2-32MHz clock speed. It supports Execute-In-Place (XIP) to allow the CPU to directly execute code from flash memory. <IRef iref="fig-nrf52-qspi-block-diagram" /> shows the internal block diagram of the QSPI peripheral.

<Image iref="fig-nrf52-qspi-block-diagram" src={import('./_assets/nrf52-qspi-block-diagram.webp')} width="400px">The internal block diagram of the QSPI peripheral on the nRF52 series MCU.[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]</Image>

The QSPI peripheral supports a deep power-down mode (DPM) to minimize current consumption when the QSPI peripheral is not in use.

<Aside type="note">
The Zephyr QSPI driver does not implement PM device power states. This means that the following WILL NOT WORK correctly to set the QSPI pins into high-impedance state when sleeping (note the use of `low-power-enable`):[^nordic-semi-devzone-unable-to-pull-spi-miso-line-down]

```txt title="pinctrl.dtsi"
&pinctrl {
    spi0_default: spi0_default {
        group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_SCK, 0, 26)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MOSI, 0, 25)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MISO, 0, 27)>;
        };
    };

    spi0_sleep: spi0_sleep {
        group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_SCK, 0, 26)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MOSI, 0, 25)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MISO, 0, 27)>;
                low-power-enable;
        };
    };
}
```

If you use the above code, you make get excess power consumption when sleeping due to the `MISO` pin floating and being in an indeterminate digital state (which causes both the N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs that form the input buffer to be partially on, causing shoot-through current to flow directly from VCC to GND).

Instead, you need to separate the pins into two groups, and make sure the `MISO` pin is in a defined state when sleeping by using `bias-pull-up` or `bias-pull-down`:

```txt title="pinctrl.dtsi"
&pinctrl {
    spi0_default: spi0_default {
        group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_SCK, 0, 26)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MOSI, 0, 25)>;
        };
        group2 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MISO, 0, 27)>;
            bias-pull-up;
        };
    };
};
```
