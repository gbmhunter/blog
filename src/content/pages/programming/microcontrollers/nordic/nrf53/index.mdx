The _nRF53 Series_ is a family of SoCs by Nordic Semiconductor. Two of their core features are Bluetooth and low-energy operation.

The nRF53 series expands on the nRF52 series of MCUs by added dual-cores. One core is designed to run the Bluetooth/networking stack, while the other core is designed to run your application's business logic.

The nRF5340-DK (nRF5340 Develop Kit) is the de facto development kit for the nRF53 series.

## Programming

nRF53 MCUs can be programmed with the Nordic _Programmer_ software (part of _Nordic Connect for Desktop_) along with a physical programmer such as a the nRF9160-DK development board.

## nrfjprog

If you are using Zephyr with nRF MCUs and get the following `nrfjprog` not found error:

```txt
-- west flash: using runner nrfjprog
FATAL ERROR: required program nrfjprog not found; install it or add its location to PATH
```

Then it might be because you need to install the Nordic "Programmer" tool. This tool is part of the nRF Connect for Desktop suite. Download nRF Connect for Desktop, and then from within it's GUI you can install Programmer.
