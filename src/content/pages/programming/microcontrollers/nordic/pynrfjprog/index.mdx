pynrfjprog is a Python wrapper around the Nordic Semiconductor nrfjprog DLL (dynamic link library). The code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pynrfjprog).

## Installation

To install pynrfjprog, into your Python environment, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pynrfjprog
```

As always, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your Python packages.

## Usage

Use `enum_emu_snr()` to enumerate the serial numbers of the connected programmers:

```python
from pynrfjprog import LowLevel

with LowLevel.API('NRF52') as api:
    serial_numbers = api.enum_emu_snr()
    if serial_numbers is None:
        print("No programmers found")
    else:
        print(f"Found {len(serial_numbers)} programmers with serial numbers: {serial_numbers}")
```

`enum_emu_snr()` returns a list of serial numbers (e.g. `[960095105, 1051285627]`). If no programmers are found, it returns `None`.
