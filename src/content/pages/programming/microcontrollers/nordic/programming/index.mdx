You can program nRF52, nRF54, nRF53, and nRF91 MCUs using the development kits from the same series (or sometimes from a different series). For example, the nRF52-DK can be used to program SoCs from the nRF52 series. I believe the development kits in the nRF91 series can program the nRF91 and nRF52 SoCs (and perhaps the other families too).

To do this, you plug the development kit into the host computer using a USB cable. You then connect the development kit to the target device using the Debug OUT connector, which is a standard 2x5 1.27mm pitch header. It follows the standard ARM SWD pinout. The schematic from the nRF52-DK (it should be either the same or very similar on other development kits) is shown in <IRef iref="fig-debug-out-connector-schematic-on-nrf52-dk" />.

The development kits have a SEGGER J-Link probe built into them (presumably Nordic Semiconductor is licensing the J-Link technology from SEGGER). It's good marketing for SEGGER too since people become familiar with the J-Link brand and then might buy a dedicated J-Link probe (they are expensive but work well).

## Making Sure You Can Only Program External Boards

One annoying issue with using the Nordic development kits for programming is that you can easily accidentally start programming the on-board MCU instead of your external board. All it takes is a loose/unplugged programming cable and the J-Link will automatically switch back to programming the on-board MCU. An easy way to prevent this is to short the `SELECT` pin on the "Debug Out" connector to GND, as shown in <IRef iref="fig-shorting-select-to-gnd-on-nrf52-dk-schematics" /> (the red squiggle is the short). This tricks the J-Link into thinking there is always an external MCU connected and making it impossible to program the on-board MCU.

Luckily, there is a `GND` pin adjacent to the `SELECT` pin on the SMD header, at it is easy to short them together with a small solder blob, as shown in <IRef iref="fig-shorting-select-to-gnd-on-nrf52-dk-photo" />.

While you are doing this, you may also want to bridge `SB32` (which can also be seen in <IRef iref="fig-shorting-select-to-gnd-on-nrf52-dk-photo" />). Bridging this connects the on-board +3.3V to the VDD pin, allowing you to power the target device from the development kit. This can be useful for one cable programming in a production environment. This only works if the current draw of the target device is small.

Also note that some nRF development kits such as the nRF9160-DK have two on-board MCUs that can be programmed (typically a nRF52 and a nRF91). A DIP switch selects the one the J-Link will program (if nothing is connected to the external programming connector).

## nrfutil

nRF Util (`nrfutil`) is a [Python](/programming/languages/python/) library and command line tool for programming and debugging Nordic Semiconductor MCUs.

### Source Code

It doesn't appear that the up-to-date source code of nRF Util is available. The older repo (`pc-nrfutil`) at https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil was deprecated and marked as archived in Jan 2023.[^nordic-semi-pc-nrfutil-repo]

### Installing Sub-Commands

By default, only a basic subset of the total available nRF Util commands are installed. You can install additional commands based on your specific needs via the `nrfutil install` command. You can use `nrfutil search` to search for installable commands.

For example:

```bash
nrfutil search 91
Command Installed Latest Status
91                0.5.0  Not installed
```

Then to install the `91` command, run:

```bash
nrfutil install 91
```

### Device Sub-Commands

The nRF Util device sub-command can list, program, recover, erase, and do various operations on Nordic devices. It supports MCUboot and J-Link. Install `device` with:

```bash
nrfutil install device
```

You can list information about a device with `nrfutil device device-info`:

```bash
$ nrfutil device device-info
serial_number: 000960036306
        boardVersion: PCA10090
        deviceFamily: NRF91_FAMILY
        deviceVersion: NRF9151_xxAA_REV3
        jlinkObFirmwareVersion: J-Link OB-K22-NordicSemi compiled Jul  8 2025 10:15:22
        protectionStatus: NRFDL_PROTECTION_STATUS_NONE
```

This lists things such as the MCU device family (and version, which is like the family, but more specific) and the protection status.

<Aside type="caution">
I connected different MCUs to the programmer and they all reported the same serial number. This makes me believe that this is the serial number of the programmer itself, rather than the MCU!
</Aside>

Device recovery can be performed with:

```bash
nrfutil device recover
```

<Image src={import('./_assets/using-nrf-util-device-recover-terminal-screenshot.webp')} width="600px">Screenshot showing device recovery (without having to erase the device) using the nrfutil device recover command.</Image>

`nrfutil device recover` can be successfully run on an already recovered device. Once recovered, you should be able to verify it worked by running `nrfutil device device-info` and checking that the protection status is `NRFDL_PROTECTION_STATUS_NONE`.

## pynrfjprog

pynrfjprog is a Python wrapper around the Nordic Semiconductor nrfjprog DLL (dynamic link library). The code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pynrfjprog).

### Installation

To install pynrfjprog, into your Python environment, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pynrfjprog
```

As always, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your Python packages.

### Usage

Use `enum_emu_snr()` to enumerate the serial numbers of the connected programmers:

```python
from pynrfjprog import LowLevel

with LowLevel.API('NRF52') as api:
    serial_numbers = api.enum_emu_snr()
    if serial_numbers is None:
        print("No programmers found")
    else:
        print(f"Found {len(serial_numbers)} programmers with serial numbers: {serial_numbers}")
```

`enum_emu_snr()` returns a list of serial numbers (e.g. `[960095105, 1051285627]`). If no programmers are found, it returns `None`.
