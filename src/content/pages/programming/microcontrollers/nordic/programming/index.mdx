You can program nRF52, nRF54, nRF53, and nRF91 MCUs using the development kits from the same series (or sometimes from a different series). For example, the nRF52-DK can be used to program SoCs from the nRF52 series. I believe the development kits in the nRF91 series can program the nRF91 and nRF52 SoCs (and perhaps the other families too).

To do this, you plug the development kit into the host computer using a USB cable. You then connect the development kit to the target device using the Debug OUT connector, which is a standard 2x5 1.27mm pitch header. It follows the standard ARM SWD pinout. The schematic from the nRF52-DK (it should be either the same or very similar on other development kits) is shown in <IRef iref="fig-debug-out-connector-schematic-on-nrf52-dk" />.

The development kits have a SEGGER J-Link probe built into them (presumably Nordic Semiconductor is licensing the J-Link technology from SEGGER). It's good marketing for SEGGER too since people become familiar with the J-Link brand and then might buy a dedicated J-Link probe (they are expensive but work well).

## Making Sure You Can Only Program External Boards

One annoying issue with using the development kits is that you can easily accidentally start programming the on-board MCU instead of your external board. All it takes is a loose/unplugged programming cable and the J-Link will automatically switch back to programming the on-board MCU. An easy way to prevent this is to short the `SELECT` pin on the "Debug Out" connector to GND, as shown in <IRef iref="fig-shorting-select-to-gnd-on-nrf52-dk-schematics" /> (the red squiggle is the short). This tricks the J-Link into thinking there is always an external MCU connected and making it impossible to program the on-board MCU.

Luckily, there is a `GND` pin adjacent to the `SELECT` pin on the SMD header, at it is easy to short them together with a small solder blob, as shown in <IRef iref="fig-shorting-select-to-gnd-on-nrf52-dk-photo" />.

While you are doing this, you may also want to bridge `SB32` (which can also be seen in <IRef iref="fig-shorting-select-to-gnd-on-nrf52-dk-photo" />). Bridging this connects the on-board +3.3V to the VDD pin, allowing you to power the target device from the development kit. This can be useful for one cable programming in a production environment. This only works if the current draw of the target device is small.
