Nordic has a range of microcontroller families. They specialize in low-power Bluetooth MCUs, and their portfolio includes the nRF52, nRF53 and nRF92 range of MCUs (they call them SOCs).

The nRF5 SDK entered maintenance mode around the year 2021-2022[^reddit-embedded-nrf5-sdk-vs-nrf-connect-sdk], with the intention that new FW projects would use the Nordic nRF Connect SDK instead.

## Access is Blocked by the SPU Error

If you get the following error:

```batch
PS C:\Users\geoff> nrfjprog --program C:\my_file.zip --verify
[ #################### ]   0.000s | Finding image components - Finished
[error] [ Client] - Encountered error -93: Command program_file executed for 79 milliseconds with result -93
[error] [  nRF91] - Failed to prepare modem coprocessor for bootloader upload
[error] [  nRF91] - Failed to initialize modem
[error] [ Worker] - Memory access failed with SECUREFAULT at 1342189832.
ERROR: Access to the selected address is blocked by the SPU.
```

The problem in my case was an old version of `nrfjprog`. After upgrading from version `10.21.0` to `10.24.2`, the above error was resolved.

Before upgrading:

```batch
PS C:\Users\geoff> nrfjprog --version
nrfjprog version: 10.21.0 external
JLinkARM.dll version: 7.94e
```

And after upgrading to `10.24.2`:

```batch
PS C:\Users\geoff> nrfjprog --version
nrfjprog version: 10.24.2 external
JLinkARM.dll version: 7.94e
```
