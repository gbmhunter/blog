The MSP430 is a popular family of microcontrollers manufactured by Texas Instruments. They were first introduced in 1992 and had a strong focus on ultra low-power operation.[^edn-the-most-popular-mcus-ever]. One stated average consumption is 4.2 nW per instruction, leading to average current consumptions less than 1 uA.[^ti-msp430-microcontroller-family] Assuming a typical CR2032 lithium coin cell battery of 220mAh, this would be a runtime of about 30 years (ignoring battery self-discharge and other factors). 

The MSP430 family has it's own 16-bit RISC CPU architecture (i.e. it does not use a 3rd party CPU architecture from a company such as ARM).

Firmware for the MSP430 can be developed in TI's own [Code Composer Studio (CCS)](/programming/integrated-development-environments-ides/code-composer-studio/) IDE. A number of other IDEs also support the MSP430, including IAR and Energia (a port of Arduino to the MSP430 architecture).

## The MSP430 Bootloader (BSL)

The MSP430 has a bootloader provided by TI called the BSL (the acronym comes from it's former name, the Boot Strap Loader).[^ti-msp430-flash-devices-bootloader-user-guide] The BSL is burnt into read-only memory in most (but not all!) of the MSP430 range of microcontrollers. It is not available in the F20xx, G2xx0, G2xx1, G2xx2, or I20xx family devices.[^wikipedia-ti-msp430]

BSL supports a number of different transport layers, including [UART](/electronics/communication-protocols/uart-communication-protocol/) (the most popular), [I2C](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/), [SPI](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/) and [USB](/electronics/communication-protocols/usb-protocol/).

The start the bootloader, a BSL entry sequence must be applied to dedicated pins. After that, a synchronization character followed by a data frame is used to communicate with the bootloader. The synchronization character (SYNC) is `0x80`. The bootloader uses this to calculate internal timing parameters. BSL sends back `DATA_ACK = 0x90` to acknowledge the `SYNC`[^ti-msp430-flash-devices-bootloader-user-guide]
