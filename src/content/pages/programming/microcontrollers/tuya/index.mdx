Tuya is a company that provides an IoT platform for developers to build IoT devices focused around the smart home industry.

Tuya has two phone apps that you can use to integrate your IoT/smart home device into, the "Tuya" and "SmartLife" apps. They are almost identical.

## Tuya Platform

Tuya provides a web-based platform to setup, design and deploy your IoT product from.

## WBR3

The WRB3 is a Wi-Fi + Bluetooth MCU module developed by Tuya that integrates into their IoT ecosystem. It uses the KM4 MCU and the W701-VA2-CG RF IC, soldered onto a carrier board with castellated pads for mounting.[^tuya-wbr3-module-datasheet]

Two of the pins are a UART TX and RX for connecting this module to the host MCU. The host MCU is responsible for things such as responding to heartbeat messages, and also initiating a reset of the WiFi and entering pairing mode. This is also a separate UART TX pin (repurposable as a GPIO) for capturing logs from the module.[^tuya-wbr3-module-datasheet]
