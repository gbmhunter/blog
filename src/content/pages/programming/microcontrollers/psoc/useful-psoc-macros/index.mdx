## Working Out What PSoC IC You Are Using

PSoC Creator will define the following variable-like macros depending on what IC you've instructed it to compile for. These are useful for including IC-specific blocks of code using the preprocessor `#ifdef` directives. These macros are defined in `cytypes.h`, which is in the `cy_boot` folder under "Generated_Source" in the Workspace Explorer window in PSoC Creator. They are included if you include the standard PSoC catch-all header `<device.h>` into your code.
    
```c
CY_PSOC3 // Any PSoC3 device
CY_PSOC4 // Any PSoC4 device
CY_PSOC5 // Any PSoC5 device (including both 5 and 5LP)
CY_PSOC5LP // Any PSoC 5LP device

// If you want to get more specific, you can check for the following...
CY_PSOC3_ES1 // PSoC3, Engineering Silicon 1
CY_PSOC3_ES2 // PSoC3, Engineering Silicon 2
CY_PSOC3_ES3 // PSoC3, Engineering Silicon 3
CY_PSOC5_ES1 // PSoC5, Engineering Silicon 1

CY_PSOC5_ES2 // PSoC5, Engineering Silicon 2

// You can use them to include code like in the following example
#if(CY_PSOC5)
    FlashLed();
#endif

// Note that #ifdef doesn't work properly! It will always evaluate to true.// Don't know why. Always use the directive #if
#ifdef CY_PSOC5 // This won't work!!!
```

Note that these are only define once the pre-compiler passes the line `#define <device.h>`, therefore there is no way to write code that detects if you are compiling on a PSoC chip, and if so, then including `device.h`. A way to get around this is to add a compiler macro as a compiler flag (e.g. `-D PSOC`), and then use the following code.

```c
// PSOC is defined by adding "-D PSOC" to the compiler build flags
#ifdef PSOC
    #include <device.h>
#endif
```
