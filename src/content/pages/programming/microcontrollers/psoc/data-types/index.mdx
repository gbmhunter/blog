## Standard Data Types

Note: The pre-defined variable types that come with the PSoC programming suites are defined both with and without the `_t` suffix that most people use to define a `typedef` (e.g. `uint8_t`). I recommend using the version with the underscore, as this increases portability (this is also supported by Linux and other Unix-like systems). It is better practice to use the data types whose size is explicitly stated (e.g. `uint32_t` rather than `unsigned int` as the latter's size is platform-dependant). The following data types are valid for all PSoC families.

```c
// Standard C data types (implicit sizes)
char
short
int
long
float
double

// Types available through <stdint.h>
int8_t
uint8_t
int16_t
uint16_t
int32_t
uint32_t
int64_t
uint64_t
size_t

// Cypress-defined data types (explicit sizes)
// Note that 64-bit data types are only availiable
// with the _t suffix
int8
uint8
int16
uint16
int32
uint32
```

These were discovered using the `sizeof()` command, and printing the result to a debug terminal.
