<WarningIsNotes />

Mbed Studio is an IDE for embedded devices. It directly ties in with the firmware framework `mbed-os` which provides a HAL and RTOS for ARM Cortex microcontrollers. Mbed Studio is based of the [Eclipse Theia IDE](https://theia-ide.org/), which is itself based of Visual Studio Code.

Mbed Studio uses ARM Compiler 6 (as of June 2020).

## Installation

Mbed Studio can be installed on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Default directory for projects is `<user-home-directory>/Mbed Programs/<project-name>`.

## Debugging

For flashing and debugging microcontrollers, Mbed Studio uses the [PyOCD](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD) library. pyOCD is an open-source Python library for programming and debugging Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers.

```bash
pyocd list
pyocd gdbserver
pyocd pack --find <microcontroller-part-num>
```

## Library Manager

With what feels like a breath of fresh air for the embedded community, Mbed Studio comes with a library manager which is designed quite well. Mbed Studio allows you to add libraries to your project via the GUI or CLI (using the `mbed add` command). The source of the library must be `os.mbed.com` URL (for open-source, shared libraries) or a git URL (for both open-source shared libraries and private libraries). 

Once the library has been added, the code is downloaded into the project directory (with the exception of the large `mbed-os`, which has the special ability of being able to be shared across multiple projects if desired). A `<project-name>.lib` file is created in the project directory which tracks the URL and commit hash of library, so that you lock down the version and can reproduce the build exactly. e.g. `mbed-os.lib` might look like:

```
https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/#a2ada74770f043aff3e61e29d164a8e78274fcd4
```

## Testing

Mbed Studio and the mbed CLI have built in support for various forms of testing. The have support for the following types of tests:

* Unit tests: These are defined as tests that run on the native development computer (i.e. not on target microcontroller).
* Functional tests: These run on the target hardware.

### Unit Tests

All unit tests should be in a `UNITTESTS` directory in the root of your project.

Mbed uses `cmake` to drive the building of the unit tests.

## Mbed Version Preprocessor Definitions

Mbed provides the following preprocessor `#define` macros in `mbed_version.h`:

```text
MBED_MAJOR_VERSION
MBED_MINOR_VERSION
MBED_PATCH_VERSION
```

## Adding Custom Boards

See [https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.0/porting/porting-custom-boards.html](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.0/porting/porting-custom-boards.html).

## HAL Support

If you get the pin configuration wrong, Mbed will print an error using `printf()` at runtime, e.g. if I configured a `BufferedSerial` and passed in the TX and RX pins in the wrong order:

```
BufferedSerial debug_uart(PA_10, PA_9); // These pins are in the wrong order, PA_9 is TX, PA_10 is RX (STM32F070 microcontroller)
```

You get the runtime error:

```
++ MbedOS Error Info ++
Error Status: 0x80010130 Code: 304 Module: 1
Error Message: pinmap not found for peripheral
Location: 0x8005AC7
Error Value: 0xA

```

## APIs

The `mbed-os` API is documented with Doxygen-style in-code comments.

### Timer

Timers can be used to keep track of periods of time in a precise manner (with typically sub-microsecond accuracy).

```c
Timer timer1;

int main() {
  timer1.start()
  while(true) {
    thread_sleep_for(500);
    print("time_us = %i\n", timer1.read_us());
  }
}
```

The timer API can be used from within interrupts.

<Aside type="caution">
The `Timer` should not be used to keep track of clock-time for long periods (e.g. hours/days). This is because the standard system clocks which drive these timers typically have a fair amount of drift and error which makes them unsuitable for accurate time keeping over long periods. Use a RTC clock and the `RTC` API instead.
</Aside>

### Serial

As of mbed v6.0, `Serial` has been deprecated in favour of `BufferedSerial` and `UnbufferedSerial`.

### SPI

```c
SPI(const spi_pinmap_t);
```

### Interrupts

Interrupts based of digital pin changes can be created and managed with `InterruptIn()` objects. For example, to create one for digital pin 5 and then print a message to the serial port everytime the voltage on the pin goes from low to high:

```c++
#include "mbed.h"

void callback() {
  printf("callback() called!\n");
}

InterruptIn interrupt_in = InterruptIn(P5);
int main() {
  event.rise(&callback);
  while(1);
}
```
