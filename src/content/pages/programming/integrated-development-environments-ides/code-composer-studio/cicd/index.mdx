title: CICD with Code Composer Studio
type: page
---

Running automatic builds and tests of your firmware whenever you make git pushes is a great way to catch bugs before they get to production. This page describes how to set up a CICD pipeline for your Code Composer Studio (CCS) projects.

Unfortunately, given the GUI-by-default nature of CCS, it does not make it easy to set up a CICD pipeline.

## Installing Code Composer Studio

Code Composer Studio can be downloaded from the internet using `wget`. This example will download version 20.2.0, update this to match the version you want to download.

```shell
wget https://dr-download.ti.com/software-development/ide-configuration-compiler-or-debugger/MD-J1VdearkvK/20.2.0/CCS_20.2.0.00012_linux.zip
```

Unzip the file:

```shell
unzip CCS_20.2.0.00012_linux.zip
```

`cd` into the directory and run the installer:

```shell
cd CCS_20.2.0.00012_linux
./ccs_setup_20.2.0.00012.run
```

Note that by default this loads up a GUI in where you can select which components you want to install. If you want to install it directly from the command line (useful in headless environments, e.g. CICD), you can provide the `--mode unattended` flag:

```shell
./ccs_setup_20.2.0.00012.run --mode unattended
```

The default installation location is:

* For regular user: `$HOME/ti/ccs<version>`
* For root user: `/opt/ti/ccs<version>`

When using the `--mode unattended` flag, by default all components will be installed. This can result in quite a large installation (approx. 7GB when I tested it). You can reduce the installation size by selecting the components you want to install. For example, to just install support for the MSP430:

```shell
./ccs_setup_20.2.0.00012.run --mode unattended --enable-components PF_MSP430
```

In my testing, just installing MSP430 support reduced the installation size from 7GB to 5.8G (not as much as I hoped).

## Installing msp430

Alas, one thing that I could not work out how to install via the command line was the msp430. But, as along as you can install it once using a GUI, you can zip up the entire `ti` folder and use that in your CICD pipeline.

To do that, install msp430ware software via the CCS GUI (go to the Resource Explorer within CCS to install it). It will install it to the same directory that CSS was installed to. On my Linux machine, this was `~/ti/

## Zipping up the CCS Installation

Now zip up the entire `ti` directory:

```shell
zip -r ti.zip ~/ti
```

## Create a Docker Image

Now that we have all the build dependencies in a zip file, we can create a Docker image that the build job will use. You don't really want to save the huge (2.5GB or so in my case) `ti` directory to the repository, so we'll upload it to Google Drive and get the Docker image build process to download it via a tool called `gdown`.

Here is the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:24.04

WORKDIR /root

RUN apt-get update

# Unzip is needed for extracting the TI dependencies
RUN apt install -y unzip

## Install git, needed for pulling submodules (if present)
RUN apt install -y git

# Install Python/pip, needed for gdown
RUN apt install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN apt install -y python3.12-venv

# Create a virtual environment for the project
RUN python3 -m venv /root/.venv

# Install gdown so we can download the TI dependencies from Google Drive
RUN /root/.venv/bin/pip install gdown

# Verify gdown is installed
RUN /root/.venv/bin/gdown --help

RUN /root/.venv/bin/gdown -O /root/ti-deps.zip <your-public-gdrive-url-goes-here>

# Extract the ti-deps.zip file to where it expects to be
# (creates a /root/ti directory)
RUN unzip /root/ti-deps.zip -d /root/
```

## Building via the Command Line

CCS provides a command line interface to build projects. The command line interface executable was installed for me at `~/ti/ccs2020/ccs/eclipse/ccs-server-cli.sh`.

<Aside type="tip">
The command line interface has changed significantly since TI moved to Eclipse Theia. This page assumes you are using Theia.
</Aside>

I thought I'd be able to be able to call this directly from anywhere with `ccs-server-cli` by installing the following symlink:

```shell
sudo ln -s ~/ti/ccs2020/ccs/eclipse/ccs-server-cli.sh /usr/local/bin/ccs-server-cli
```

Unfortunately, while the symlink works fine, it seems that the script expects the CWD (current working directory) to be the directory it is installed in. So no bueno.

Ok, so let's run all the commands from within the CCS directory. Within your CICD pipeline, you should run the following steps to build your project from the GUI. This assumed this job is running inside a Docker container created from the image above. I didn't find a way to have the cloned repo location to act as a valid TI CCS workspace, so there is a step below to import the repo into a new workspace before running the build command.

```shell
cd /root/ti/ccs2020/ccs/eclipse
./ccs-server-cli.sh -noSplash -workspace /root/workspace/ -application com.ti.ccs.apps.importProject -ccs.location <where your CI clones your repo to>
./ccs-server-cli.sh -noSplash -workspace /root/workspace/ -application com.ti.ccs.apps.buildProject -ccs.workspace
```

All done!

## Uninstalling CCS

You can uninstall CSS using the `uninstall_ccs.run` script that is placed in the CCS installation directory. For example:

```shell
~/ti/ccs2020/ccs$ ./uninstall_ccs.run
```

This will provide a GUI to uninstall the components.

## Old Attempt

When installing CCS inside Docker, I got an install error due to the `init.d` directory not being found (CCS copies `udev` rules into that directory). To fix this, I created `/etc/init.d/` directory and a dummy `udev` executable inside this directory.

```dockerfile
RUN echo "Creating dummy udev script..." && \
    mkdir -p /etc/init.d && \
    printf '#!/bin/sh\nexit 0\n' > /etc/init.d/udev && \
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/udev
```
