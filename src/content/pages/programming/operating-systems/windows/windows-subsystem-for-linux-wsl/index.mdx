<WarningIsNotes />

## Command-Line

You can jump into the WSL by typing `wsl` inside a Windows terminal:

```powershell
wsl
```

It will jump into the WSL and set the current working directory to the same directory as in Windows, e.g. if you were in `C:\Users\username\` in Windows, when you type `wsl` it will land you at `/mnt/c/Users/username/`.

VS Code has an extension for WSL. It allows you write/run code inside WSL whilst editing in VS Code running in Windows (i.e. the same way VS Code supports remote development).

From inside WSL, if you type the command `code .`, it will open at VS Code in Windows and setup a remote development session into WSL at the current working directory.

```bash
wsl --shutdown
```

Must be run from terminal with Administrator privileges:

```bash
wsl --upgrade
```

You can set the default distribution with:

```bash
wsl --set-default <distro-name>
```

The default distribution is the one which will load if you just type `wsl` at the command-line in Windows.

## Upgrading From WSL 1 To WSL 2

If you first enabled/installed WSL a long time ago, you might be running WSL 1. WSL 2 is a big upgrade over WSL 1 -- WSL 1 used a "wrapper" to convert Linux system calls into Windows calls, whilst WSL 2 features a full Linux virtual machine (similar to VirtualBox).

## Passing Through USB Devices

WSL 1 and 2 do not natively support USB pass-through like VirtualBox does. However, there is a popular 3rd party tool called [usbipd-win](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) which can do the job. There was a update to WSL 2 to allow `usbipd` to work without too much hassle.

> Windows software for sharing locally connected USB devices to other machines, including Hyper-V guests and WSL 2. -- usbipd-win.

The first thing you have to do is "bind" the USB device to `usbipd`. This needs to be done on the Windows host from a command-line with Administrator privileges:

```powershell
usbipd bind --busid <busid>
```

You can identify a device either with a `busid` in the form `<number>-<number>` (e.g. `9-4`) or a `hardware-id` in the form `<VID:PID>` (e.g. `0483:df11`).

<Aside type="note">
I prefer to use the `busid` (which is always unique) rather than the `hardware-id` as I normally have multiple identical USB devices connected (e.g. multiple nRF52 DKs acting as J-Link devices) which all have the same `hardware-id`.
</Aside>

You might get the error "Loading vhci_hcd failed" when trying to attach a USB device from the Windows host, like shown below:

```text
usbipd attach -w -a -b 9-4
usbipd: info: Using WSL distribution 'Ubuntu' to attach; the device will be available in all WSL 2 distributions.
usbipd: info: Loading vhci_hcd module.
usbipd: error: Loading vhci_hcd failed.
```
One thing to try is to manually load the module inside WSL. From within your Linux distro, run:

```bash
sudo modprobe vhci_hcd
```

And then try to attach the USB device again.

If you want to use the USB device in Windows again, you can use `detach` to detach the device from WSL:

```powershell
usbipd detach --busid <busid>
```

### usbipd: error: Loading vhci_hcd failed

After using WSL for a while, I started getting `usbipd: error: Loading vhci_hcd failed.` errors when trying to attach a USB device into WSL (when running the `usbipd attach ...` command). Running `sudo modprobe vhc_hcd` inside WSL fixed the issue. But this was still a pain because I had to run it every time I started up WSL again. To make it persistent, I added `command="modprobe vhci_hcd"` to my `/etc/wsl.conf` inside WSL (which already contained `systemd=true`):

```text title="/etc/wsl.conf"
[boot]
systemd=true
command="modprobe vhci_hcd"
```

## Installing Chrome on WSL

You can install Chrome on WSL by running the following command:

```bash
cd ~/tmp
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt -y install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

You can then run Chrome by typing `google-chrome` in the terminal.
