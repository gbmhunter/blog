title: nRF52 DK Embassy Tutorial
type: page
---

This is a tutorial for building an Embassy application for the nRF52 DK, which features a nRF52832 SoC. The build is done in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), but these instructions should work for any Linux distribution.

## Installing Rust and Probe-RS

Before we can build the project, we need to install Rust. This is done with the `rustup` tool:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Press enter when prompted to install it in the default location.

We'll also need to install `probe-rs`. You can try this method:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/releases/latest/download/probe-rs-tools-installer.sh | sh
```

However, I got an error that my version of glibc was too old. So I used this method instead, which builds it from source:

```bash
cargo install probe-rs-tools --locked
```

This worked, and gave me the following result:

```bash
Installed package `probe-rs-tools v0.29.0` (executables `cargo-embed`, `cargo-flash`, `probe-rs`)
```

We'll also need to install the `thumbv7em-none-eabi` target using `rustup`. Luckily if you try and `cargo build` without this is will tell you how to install it.

```bash
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi
```

## Creating a New Rust Project

Create a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo new nrf52-example
```

This will create a new directory called `nrf52-example` and populate it  with a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` directory containing a `main.rs`.

## Opening the Project in VSCode

This tutorial assumes you are using VSCode, although most IDEs will work similarly. Open the newly created project folder `~/nrf52-example` in VSCode.

Install the [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension for VSCode. Without this, VS Code will give you syntax highlighting for Rust code, but not much else.

## Updating the Files

Replace the contents of `main.rs` with the following, which is a basic blinky program for LED1 which is connected to pin `P0.17`.

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_nrf::gpio::{Level, Output, OutputDrive};
use embassy_time::Timer;
use {defmt_rtt as _, panic_probe as _};

#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(_spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());
    let mut led = Output::new(p.P0_17, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);

    loop {
        led.set_high();
        Timer::after_millis(300).await;
        led.set_low();
        Timer::after_millis(300).await;
    }
}
```

`no_std` is used to tell the compiler not to add or link against the standard Rust library, instead just relying on the core library (which is a subset of the standard library).

`no_main` is used to tell the compiler not to look for a `main` function. A `main` function will still be defined, but this is taken care of us by Embassy.

At this point, `rust-analyzer` should give you the following error:

<Image src={import('./_assets/rust-analyzer-cant-find-crate-for-test-error.webp')} width="600px">Screenshot of the `rust-analyzer` error before modifying the settings.</Image>

To fix this, add the following to you `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
    "rust-analyzer.check.allTargets": false
}
```

Next, create a file at the path `.cargo/config.toml` with the following contents (this is mostly copied from the [Embassy example config.toml file](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/main/examples/nrf52840/.cargo/config.toml), but with the `--allow-erase-all` flag added to the `runner` line):

```toml title=".cargo/config.toml"
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-rs run --chip nRF52832_xxAA --allow-erase-all"

[build]
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"

[env]
DEFMT_LOG = "trace"
```

The `runner =` line tells cargo what to do when you run `cargo run`. This will be used to program the nRF52 DK.

Also create a `memory.x` file in the project root directory with the following contents:

```text title="memory.x"
MEMORY
{
  /* NOTE 1 K = 1 KiBi = 1024 bytes */
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 512K
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
}
```

`memory.x` is used to tell the linker where to put the code and data in the flash and RAM. This file will change depending on the microcontroller you are using.

## Installing Dependencies and Building

Although you can add dependencies with `cargo add`, there are quite a few features for some of the dependencies that need adding. The easiest way to do this is to edit the `Cargo.toml` file.

I grabbed the `Cargo.toml` file from the Embassy nRF52840 example, and removed all the `path = ...` statements (it was using relative paths to the dependencies). It ended up looking like this:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
edition = "2021"
name = "nrf52-example"
version = "0.1.0"
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[dependencies]
embassy-futures = { version = "0.1.0" }
embassy-sync = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["defmt"] }
embassy-executor = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["arch-cortex-m", "executor-thread", "executor-interrupt", "defmt"] }
embassy-time = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["defmt", "defmt-timestamp-uptime"] }
embassy-nrf = { version = "0.3.1", features = ["defmt", "nrf52832", "time-driver-rtc1", "gpiote", "unstable-pac", "time"] }
embassy-net = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["defmt", "tcp", "dhcpv4", "medium-ethernet"] }
embassy-usb = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["defmt"] }
embedded-io = { version = "0.6.0", features = ["defmt-03"]  }
embedded-io-async = { version = "0.6.1", features = ["defmt-03"] }
embassy-net-esp-hosted = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["defmt"] }
embassy-net-enc28j60 = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["defmt"] }

defmt = "1.0.1"
defmt-rtt = "1.0.0"

fixed = "1.10.0"
static_cell = { version = "2" }
cortex-m = { version = "0.7.6", features = ["inline-asm", "critical-section-single-core"] }
cortex-m-rt = "0.7.0"
panic-probe = { version = "1.0.0", features = ["print-defmt"] }
rand = { version = "0.9.0", default-features = false }
embedded-storage = "0.3.1"
usbd-hid = "0.8.1"
serde = { version = "1.0.136", default-features = false }
embedded-hal = { version = "1.0" }
embedded-hal-async = { version = "1.0" }
embedded-hal-bus = { version = "0.1", features = ["async"] }
num-integer = { version = "0.1.45", default-features = false }
microfft = "0.5.0"

[profile.release]
debug = 2
```

Now that we have all the dependencies listed, we can build the project.

```bash
cargo build
```

## Pass-through nRF52 DK USB device to WSL

Plugging the nRF52 DK into my Windows computer, the J-Link based debugger is detected. Using [usbipd](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win), I can pass-through the connected nRF52 DK from Windows into WSL. First you have to bind the USB device from a terminal on Windows with admin privileges:

```bash
usbipd bind -i 1366:1051
```

You only have to do the bind once. Then you use `usbipd attach` to pass it through. Run this next command from a standard terminal (not one with admin privileges).

```bash
usbipd attach -w -a -i 1366:1051
```

The `-w` flag is to attach to WSL, and `-a` is for auto-attach. If it passed through correctly, you should be able to detect it in WSL using `probe-rs list`.

```bash
gbmhunter@geoff-laptop:~/nrf52-example$ probe-rs list
The following debug probes were found:
[0]: J-Link -- 1366:1051:001050376416 (J-Link)
```

## Flashing the nRF52 DK

Now that we have attached the debugger, we can now flash the nRF52 DK using `cargo run`:

```bash
cargo run
```

<Aside type="note">
You might notice that `cargo run` does not return you to the terminal. This is because is opens up serial communication via RTT so that you can print information. More on this below.
</Aside>

If you have multiple debuggers attached, `probe-rs` will ask you to select which one to use.

<Image src={import('./_assets/probe-rs-multiple-debuggers-attached-asks-for-selection.webp')} width="800px">Screenshot of `probe-rs` asking you to select which debugger to use.</Image>

The first time I tried to program the nRF52 DK, I got the following error:

```text
 WARN probe_rs::vendor::nordicsemi::sequences::nrf52: Core is locked. Erase procedure will be started to unlock it.
Error: Connecting to the chip was unsuccessful.

Caused by:
    0: An ARM specific error occurred.
    1: An operation could not be performed because it lacked the permission to do so: erase_all
```

I managed to fix this by adding the flag `--allow-erase-all` to the `probe-rs run` command in the `.cargo/config.toml` file.

```toml title=".cargo/config.toml"
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-rs run --chip nRF52832_xxAA --allow-erase-all"
```

## Adding Logging

Logging is trivial to add to this project. First, we need to import `defmt` with:

```rust
use defmt;
```

And then we can log a info level message with:

```rust
defmt::info!("Hello, world!");
```

<Image src={import('./_assets/hello-world-log-from-embassy.webp')} width="800px">The output I get when using `defmt` to log a message.</Image>

## A Slightly More Complex Example

The above example was trivially simple, so let's expand on it a bit. Let's add a second executor, and make that responsible for blinking the LED. We will re-purpose the primary executor to show how to use `select` to wait for multiple events (futures) at the same time.

The basic syntax for `select` is:

```rust
match select(future1, future2).await {
    // ...
}
```

`select` will return as soon as one of the futures is ready. A `match` statement can then be used to work out what future is ready and handle it appropriately.

<Aside type="note">
`select` is defined for 2-4 futures with `select`, `select3` and `select4`. If you have more than 4, you can pass in an array of futures instead.
</Aside>

Update our `main.rs` file to look like this:

```rust title="main.rs"
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use defmt;
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_nrf::gpio::{AnyPin, Level, Pin, Output, OutputDrive};
use embassy_time::{Duration, Ticker, Timer};
use {defmt_rtt as _, panic_probe as _};
use embassy_futures::select::{select, Either};

#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());

    spawner.spawn(blink(p.P0_17.degrade())).unwrap();

    defmt::info!("Application has started.");

    let mut ticker1 = Ticker::every(Duration::from_millis(1000));
    let mut ticker2 = Ticker::every(Duration::from_millis(1200));

    loop {
        match select(ticker1.next(), ticker2.next()).await {
            Either::First(_) => defmt::info!("1000ms timer"),
            Either::Second(_) => defmt::info!("1200ms timer"),
        }
    }
}

#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn blink(pin: AnyPin) {
    let mut led = Output::new(pin, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);

    loop {
        led.set_high();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
        led.set_low();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
    }
}
```
