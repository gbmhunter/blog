Embassy is a Rust framework for building embedded applications. It leverages async/await for cooperative multitasking. It also supports multiple "executors" for true preemptive multitasking.

In my opinion, although `async/await` seems like a great way to write co-operative code, it does force you to write code that only awaits on one thing at once, which is a major gotcha which makes me believe event driven state machines are a better option.
