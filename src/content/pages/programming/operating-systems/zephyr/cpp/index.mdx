title: How to Use C++ With Zephyr
type: page
---

Zephyr has pretty good support for [C++](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/).

Not sure if you want to use C++ for embedded development? Check out my article [C++ on Embedded Systems](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/cpp-on-embedded-systems/) for more information.

## Enabling C++ Support

You can enable support for compiling C++ by adding the following into `prj.conf`:

```python title="prj.conf"
CONFIG_CPP=y
```

You can then change `main.c` to `main.cpp`. Remember to update the path in the `CMakeLists.txt` file also! However, you will still be missing a lot of the C++ standard library (e.g. `std::functional`). To make this available, add the following to your `prj.conf`:

```python title="prj.conf"
# Adds the full C++ standard library
CONFIG_REQUIRES_FULL_LIBCPP=y
```

Remember you can call C code from C++, but not the other way around (well -- technically you can, but it general if you are using classes and other C++ stuff you can't). So one migration technique is that once your `main.cpp` file is working, you can upgrade some of your core application code to C++ but leave things like drivers and libraries in C. And of course, you can still access the Zephyr API (which is written in C) from your C++ code. All the Zephyr headers are wrapped in `extern C` allowing you to call them easily from C++.

### Choosing a C++ Standard

By default, Zephyr will use the C++11 standard. This is quite old these days, and you will likely want to use a newer standard. As of June 2025, Zephyr supports up to C++20. You can select the version you want from one of the following:[^zephyr-kconfig-config-std-cpp]

* CONFIG_STD_CPP98
* CONFIG_STD_CPP11
* CONFIG_STD_CPP14
* CONFIG_STD_CPP17
* CONFIG_STD_CPP2A
* CONFIG_STD_CPP20
* CONFIG_STD_CPP2B

Just add the one you want with an `=y` to your `prj.conf` file, e.g.:

```python title="prj.conf"
CONFIG_STD_CPP20=y # Use C++20
```

I didn't notice any significant RAM or flash increase just by including the full C++ standard library, so you only pay for what you use.

You should now be able to compile the Zephyr application with C++ code. In summary, your `prj.conf` should look something like this:

```python title="prj.conf"
CONFIG_CPP=y
CONFIG_REQUIRES_FULL_LIBCPP=y
CONFIG_STD_CPP20=y
```

<Aside type="note">
I tried overriding the limitation to C++20 and use C++23 by providing the compiler flag `-std=c++23` after the `-std=c++20` flag inserted by Zephyr. However I could not get this to work and resigned to C++20.
</Aside>

## Logging

At some point when using C++, you are going to want to place logging calls in header files. This is true for any template code (which has to be in the header file) or for any class functions which you can't be bothered defining in a separate `.cpp` file.

You have to add `LOG_MODULE_DECLARE(<module_name>);` to the beginning of any function in the header file which you want to log from.

I think Zephyr's instance based logging is a bit of a mess and don't really use it. This is unfortunate as it would have paired well with instances of C++ classes.

## Expected

Since C++23 is not supported yet in Zephyr (as of June 2025), we can't get `std::expected`. However, TartanLlama (Sy Brand) has created a replacement implementation that is supported on C++11 and later. You can find the repository [here on GitHub](https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected).

To add this dependency into your project, add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
# Disable packaging for TlExpected
set(EXPECTED_BUILD_PACKAGE OFF CACHE BOOL "Disable TlExpected packaging" FORCE)
set(EXPECTED_BUILD_TESTS OFF CACHE BOOL "Disable TlExpected tests" FORCE)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    TlExpected
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected
    GIT_TAG v1.1.0
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(TlExpected)

# The target 'expected' (aliased as tl::expected) is now configured.
# Link against the alias provided by the library.
target_link_libraries(app PUBLIC tl::expected)
```

This uses `FetchContent` to automatically download the repository and make it available to your project. `EXPECTED_BUILD_PACKAGE` and `EXPECTED_BUILD_TESTS` both need to be set to `OFF` to prevent compiler errors since the Zephyr build environment does not support testing or packaging the library (we just want the header files).

## Exceptions 

Exceptions are disabled by default when you enable C++ support Zephyr. If you try and add a `throw std::runtime_error("test");` to your code, you will get the following compiler error:

```text
error: exception handling disabled, use '-fexceptions' to enable
```

You can enable exceptions by adding the following to your `prj.conf` file:

```python title="prj.conf"
CONFIG_CPP_EXCEPTIONS=y
```

You can only enable exceptions if you:

* Have enabled C++ with `CONFIG_CPP=y`.
* Have not enabled `CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC_NANO` or `CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBCPP`.

<Aside type="note">
You need to enable exceptions via the `prj.conf`. Just adding the compiler flag in your CMakeLists.txt file like so will not work:

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
target_compile_options(app PRIVATE -fexceptions)
```

as Zephyr add it's own compiler flag `-fno-exceptions` which will appear after the one you specify.
</Aside>

Whether or not you want to use C++ exceptions is something you should consider carefully. If my understanding is correct, exceptions will usually use dynamic memory allocation to store the thrown exception. This will forbid exceptions if you have a rule about no dynamic memory allocation or no dynamic memory allocation after initialization.
