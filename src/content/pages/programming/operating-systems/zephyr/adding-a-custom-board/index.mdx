title: Adding a Custom Board to Zephyr

<WarningIsNotes />

This tutorial assumes your custom board has a nRF52840 SoC on it. However, the process is similar for other SoCs, just replace the `nrf52840` with the appropriate SoC name.

Zephyr changes the way it defines boards in version ???.

Many MCU manufacturers provide example projects for their boards. These can be a great starting point for your own custom board. These boards are usually located in the Zephyr repo.

## Folder Structure

There are a few different ways to structure a Zephyr project. I prefer to have the application code reside in a `app/` directory, and all of the dependencies that are managed by `west` inside a directory called `external/` (you could this whatever you want, e.g. `deps/` or `libs/`). Before adding the custom board, this is what my folder structure looked like:

```text
.west/
└── config
app/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── Kconfig
├── Kconfig.zephyr
├── main.cpp
├── prj.conf
└── west.yml
external/
└── zephyr/
```

## Decide on a Board Name

The board name is used to identify the board in a number of places. I recommend picking a name that is in lowercase, and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores. For this example, we will use the name `my_board`.

## Add the Board Folder

Within our project root, create a `boards/` directory. Inside that, create another directory called `my_board/`.

## Specifying a Board Root

In your `.west/config` file, specify the relative board root directory:

```python title=".west/config"
[build]
cmake-args = -DBOARD_ROOT=../
```

This is the root directory of our project, which contains the `boards` directory. My complete `.west/config` file looked like this:

```python title=".west/config"
[manifest]
path = app
file = west.yml

[build]
cmake-args = -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DBOARD_ROOT=../

[zephyr]
base = external/zephyr
```

## Build

Now you should be able to build your project:

```shell
cd app/
west build -b my_board/nrf52840
```
