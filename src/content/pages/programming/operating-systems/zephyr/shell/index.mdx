[Zephyr features a "shell"](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/shell/index.html) (one of it's modules) that it can provide over a serial transport such as a UART, USB or Segger RTT. The shell provides to the user things such as Linux command-line style commands, logging, auto-complete, command history and more. In  It is great for implementing a debug interface to control your microcontroller from a terminal application such as [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/) (shameless plug, I developed this app).

Zephyr provides an API that the firmware can use to define the commands available to the user over the shell.

## Basic Shell Usage

```python
CONFIG_SHELL=y
```

This might be all you need to get a basic shell working across the default serial transport (whatever `printf()` sends to). You should see the shell print a prompt to your terminal, e.g. `uart:~$ `.

## Adding Commands

The API is provided by `#include <zephyr/shell/shell.h>`.

The macro `SHELL_CMD_REGISTER()` can be used to register a new root command. Let's add a basic root command.

```c++
static int helloCallback(const struct shell* shell, size_t argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("Hello, world!");
    return 0;
}

SHELL_CMD_REGISTER(hello, NULL, "Say hello", helloCallback);
```

## Pointer to Specific Shell Instances

You can get a pointer to specific shell instances by using commands such as `shell_backend_uart_get_ptr()` (declared in `zephyr/shell/shell_uart.h`) or `shell_backend_rtt_get_ptr()` (declared in `zephyr/shell/shell_rtt.h`). For example, if you have a UART backend, you can use:

```c
#include <zephyr/shell/shell_uart.h>

int main() {
    struct shell * main_shell;
    main_shell = shell_backend_uart_get_ptr();
    __ASSERT(main_shell != NULL, "Failed to get shell backend.");
}
```

`shell_set_bypass()` can be used to bypass the shell and send raw data to the serial port.

You can pass in `NULL` to clear an existing bypass, e.g.:

```c
shell_set_bypass(sh, NULL);
```

The model_shell example project makes use of this bypass feature to provide a direct AT command mode between the shell and the modem.

## Shell Login

You can somewhat easily implement a login shell with Zephyr, which protects all the commands behind a simple root-level password that is required to "login".

Setting `CONFIG_SHELL_CMDS_SELECT=y` in `prj.conf` will allow you to select which shell commands are available. Then you can call `shell_set_root_cmd()` from C code to set a root command. `shell_set_root_cmd(NULL)` will clear the root command and go back to showing all available commands.

`shell_obscure_set(sh, true)` causes all logs to stop. Then calling `shell_obscure_set(sh, false)` did not restore the logging. After a while a hard fault occurred, likely due to the log messages building up and overflowing some buffer. I managed to fix this by re-enabling the shell logging backend with `z_shell_log_backend_enable()`:

```c
z_shell_log_backend_enable(sh->log_backend, (void *)sh, sh->ctx->log_level);
```

Another way to fix this is to just stop and start the shell with:

```c
// Fix to restore logging
shell_stop(sh);
shell_start(sh);
```

These stop and start functions call `z_shell_log_backend_disable()` and `z_shell_log_backend_enable()` internally.

Below is the source code to create a login shell. It relies on a `PRODUCTION_BUILD` macro to determine if the login prompt should be shown or not, as in a development build it can be a pain to have to login each time you want to use the shell.

```c title="LoginCmd.c"
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>
#include <zephyr/shell/shell.h>
#include <zephyr/shell/shell_uart.h>
#include <zephyr/init.h>

/**
 * The password for the shell login.
 */
#define SHELL_PASSWORD "zephyr"

static int LoginInit(void)
{
    // Only enable login in production builds, otherwise skip past the login prompt
#if PRODUCTION_BUILD == 1
    printk("Please login with password to continue.\n");
    if (!CONFIG_SHELL_CMD_ROOT[0]) {
        shell_set_root_cmd("login");
    }
    struct shell const * sh = shell_backend_uart_get_ptr();
    // Obscure the input so that the password is not visible
    shell_obscure_set(sh, true);

    // Disable logging to the console so that we don't see it at the login prompt
    z_shell_log_backend_disable(sh->log_backend);
#else
    printk("Development build. Login is not required.\n");
#endif
    return 0;
}

static int CheckPassword(char *passwd)
{
    return strcmp(passwd, SHELL_PASSWORD);
}

static int CmdLogin(const struct shell* sh, size_t argc, char** argv)
{
    static uint32_t attempts;

    if (CheckPassword(argv[1]) != 0)
    {
        shell_error(sh, "Incorrect password!");
        attempts++;
        if (attempts > 3)
        {
            k_sleep(K_SECONDS(attempts));
        }
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    // Clear history so password not visible there
    z_shell_history_purge(sh->history);
    shell_obscure_set(sh, false);
    
    shell_set_root_cmd(NULL);
    shell_prompt_change(sh, "uart:~$ ");
    z_shell_log_backend_enable(sh->log_backend, (void *)sh, sh->ctx->log_level);

    shell_print(sh, "Logged in successfully! Hit tab for help. Use the command \"logout\" to log back out.\n");
    attempts = 0;
    return 0;
}

static int CmdLogout(const struct shell* sh, size_t argc, char** argv)
{
    shell_set_root_cmd("login");
    shell_obscure_set(sh, true);
    shell_prompt_change(sh, "login: ");
    // Disable logging to the console so that we don't see it at the login prompt
    z_shell_log_backend_disable(sh->log_backend);
    shell_print(sh, "\n");
    return 0;
}

SHELL_CMD_ARG_REGISTER(login, NULL, "<password>", CmdLogin, 2, 0);

SHELL_CMD_REGISTER(logout, NULL, "Log out.", CmdLogout);

SYS_INIT(LoginInit, APPLICATION, CONFIG_APPLICATION_INIT_PRIORITY);
```

`shell_prompt_change(sh, "login: ")` is used to change the shell prompt to `login:` so that it's obvious to the user that they need to login before doing anything else.

An example of shell login can be found [here](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/samples/subsys/shell/shell_module/prj_login.conf).
