Zephyr provides a state machine framework (SMF) which can be used to implement finite state machines (FSMs) and hierarchical state machines (HSMs). SMF was added to Zephyr in `v2.7.0`[^zephyr-release-notes-v2-7-0].

## Building A FSM

The first thing you need to do is enable the framework in your `prj.conf`:

```python
CONFIG_SMF=y
```

Then, you can start creating a state machine in a `.c` file. First things first, make sure to import the SMF header file:

```c
#include <zephyr/smf.h>
```

You will likely want to access data within your state machine. The recommended way to do this is to create a `struct` to hold your data, with the first member being special `struct smf_ctx ctx`. The SMF will pass this object to all of your state machine functions, and also access and modify the `ctx` member to keep track of the state machines internal state.

```c
typedef struct {
    struct smf_ctx ctx;
    // User defined data goes here
    uint32_t event;
} MyStateMachine;
```

We also need to define our states as an enumeration:

```c
typedef enum {
    S1,
    S2,
} MyState;
```

Now let's create some state machine functions. The SMF is designed so that you can have up to three functions per state:

1. **The entry function**: Called whenever the state machine enters the state.
2. **The run function**: Called when the state machine is in this state and `smf_run_state()` is called.
3. **The exit function**: Called whenever the state machine exits the state.

Let's create a simple FSM (no hierarchical states) with two states: `s1` and `s2`.

```c
static void s1_entry(void *data) {
    printf("State 1 entry.\n");
}

static void s1_run(void *data) {
    printf("State 1 run.\n");

static void s1_exit(void *data) {
    printf("State 1 exit.\n");
}

static void s2_entry(void *data) {
    printf("State 2 entry.\n");
}

static void s2_run(void *data) {
    printf("State 2 run.\n");
}

static void s2_exit(void *data) {
    printf("State 2 exit.\n");
}
```

The `void *data` parameter is actually a pointer to the state machine object (e.g. of type `MyStateMachine *` in our example). You can safely cast this `void *data` pointer to the correct type and access "member variables" of the state machine object. For example:

```c
static void s1_run(void *data) {
    // Cast the data pointer to the correct type
    MyStateMachine *obj = (MyStateMachine *)data;
    // Now we can access member variables
    printf("myEvent: %d.\n", obj->myEvent);
}
```

### Transitioning Between States

You can call the `smf_set_state()` function inside state `run()` functions to transition to a different state. The below example makes the state machine transition from `S1` to `S2` when the `event` member of the `MyStateMachine` object is set to `1`.

```c
static void s1_run(void *data) {
    MyStateMachine *obj = (MyStateMachine *)data;
    if (obj->event == 1) {
        smf_set_state(SMF_CTX(obj), &l_myStateTable[S2]);
        // We are now in state S2!
        return;
    }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
Note that state transitions are not queued, they happen immediately. So the appropriate `exit()` and `entry()` functions for the state transition will be called by the time `smf_set_state()` returns. You should normally make sure to `return` after the call to `smf_set_state()` or otherwise make sure that no other old state logic is executed.
</Aside>

We need to register all these functions using a state table. We can use the `SMF_CREATE_STATE()` macro to create the state table easily. It takes 5 parameters:

```c
SMF_CREATE_STATE(entry_function, run_function, exit_function, parent, initial)
```

The `parent` parameter is optional and can be used to create a hierarchical state machine (more on this below). The `initial` parameter is optional and can be used to set the initial state of the state machine.

```c
// Populate state table
static const struct smf_state l_myStateTable[] = {
        [S1] = SMF_CREATE_STATE(s1_entry, s1_run, s1_exit, NULL, NULL),
        [S2] = SMF_CREATE_STATE(s2_entry, s2_run, s2_exit, NULL, NULL),
};
```

We can then run the state machine!

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Create state machine object
    MyStateMachine sm;

    // Set initial state
    smf_set_initial(SMF_CTX(&sm), &l_myStateTable[S1]);

    // Run the state machine
    while(1) {
        int32_t ret = smf_run_state(SMF_CTX(&sm));
        if (ret) {
            // State machine terminates if a non-zero value is returned
            break;
        }
        k_msleep(1000);
    }
}
```

Note that the example above is not very ideal since is sleeps for 1s between calls to the `run()` function of whatever state it is in. This would make the state machine seem unresponsive. If you decrease the sleep time, the state machine will appear more responsive, but you'll end up churning through CPU cycles needlessly. This would be an issue in a multi-threaded application or if low power consumption is a concern. A better approach is to build a event system alongside the state machine. When events arrive, they are handled by the state machine. Events could be created by interrupts, timers, or other threads. Because you cannot pass extra variables into state functions, you have to save the event data to the `sm` object which the state functions have access to.

Below is pseudo code of the idea:

```c
while(1) {
    event = eventQueue.get(); // Blocks until an event is available
    sm.event = event; // Save the event to the state machine object, this is the only way to get data "into" the state machine
    smf_run_state(SMF_CTX(&sm)); // Run the state machine
}
```

<IRef iref="tbl-smf-prj-conf-options" /> lists the different options you can set in your `prj.conf` to configure the SMF[^zephyr-docs-smf].

### Hierarchical State Machines

SMF supports hierarchical state machines (HSMs). HSMs are very useful in real-world applications for managing complex systems. They help manage complexity and reduce code duplication by allowing you to group states into sub-trees and have events propagate "up" to parent states until they are handled.

To create a HSM, you pretty much do the same thing as with a FSM, except you provide a non-null `parent` parameter to the `SMF_CREATE_STATE()` macro. For example:

```c
// Populate state table
static const struct smf_state l_myStateTable[] = {
    [ROOT] = SMF_CREATE_STATE(root_entry, root_run, root_exit, NULL, NULL),
    [S1] = SMF_CREATE_STATE(s1_entry, s1_run, s1_exit, &l_myStateTable[ROOT], NULL),
    [S1A] = SMF_CREATE_STATE(s1a_entry, s1a_run, s1a_exit, &l_myStateTable[S1], NULL),
    [S1B] = SMF_CREATE_STATE(s1b_entry, s1b_run, s1b_exit, &l_myStateTable[S1], NULL),
    [S2] = SMF_CREATE_STATE(s2_entry, s2_run, s2_exit, &l_myStateTable[ROOT], NULL),
};
```

The state functions (`entry()`, `run()`, and `exit()`) are defined in the exact same way as with a FSM. This would create the state machine shown in <IRef iref="fig-hierarchical-state-diagram" />.

<Aside type="tip">
A `root` state that is a parent to all other states is useful those situations where you want to catch and handle an event no matter what state you might be in (e.g. to respond to an error event). 
</Aside>

Transitioning between states in HSMs follows these rules:

* All of the exit functions from the current state up to but not including the lowest common ancestor (LCA) state are called. The current state exit function is called first, and then in order working upwards towards the LCA (but not the LCA itself).
* All of the entry functions from (but not including) the LCA state down to the next state are called. The entry functions are called in order from the child of the LCA all the way down to the next state.

If we use our `root`, `S1`, `S1A`, `S1B`, and `S2` states from the example above, the transitions would be handled as follows:

* An initial transition to `S1` would call `root_entry()` and `s1_entry()`.
* `EVT1` arriving would cause a transition from `S1` to `S1A`. This is a transition to a child state and would just call `s1a_entry()`.
* `EVT2` arriving would cause a transition from `S1A` to `S1B`. This is a transition to a sibling state and would call `s1a_exit()` then `s1b_entry()`.
* `EVT3` arriving would cause a transition from `S1B` to `S2`. This is a transition to a different branch of the state machine and would call `s1b_exit()`, `s1_exit()`, and then `s2_entry()`.

<Aside type="tip">
You don't have to be have different events to cause different transitions! You can re-use the same event for different transitions in different states. In fact, in this example, we could have just had one single event responsible for all transitions.
</Aside>

### Event Propagation

When you call `smf_run_state()` with a HSM, the current states `run()` function is not the only one that can be called. The SMF library will also call the `run()` function of all ancestor states, unless the event is deemed handled. The event is considered handled if ANY of the following occur:

1. `smf_set_state()` is called.
2. `smf_set_handled()` is called.

Event propagation is a powerful way of generalizing code and reducing duplication by adding handlers to parent states that will then be applied to all child states (presuming they don't handle the event themselves).

## Practical Guidelines

### Use Large Comment Blocks

A large state machine in a `.c` or `.cpp` file can be difficult for unfamiliar developers to understand. State diagrams can help, but they require maintenance to keep them in sync with the code. Instead, I recommend adding large comment blocks before each state with the state name (including the hierarchy, which I like to write in "path" format, e.g. `root/parent_state/child_state`) and a brief description of what the state does.

```c
/* ======================================================================== */
/* root/mode_1/idle: Initial idle state. */
/* ======================================================================== */
static void idle_entry(void *data) {
    printf("idle entry.\n");
}

static void idle_run(void *data) {
    printf("idle run.\n");
}

static void idle_exit(void *data) {
    printf("idle exit.\n");
}

/* ======================================================================== */
/* root/mode_1/run: Runs when an event ID of 1 occurs. */
/* ======================================================================== */

// ...

/* ======================================================================== */
/* root/mode_2: Error state, device goes into disabled state until manual reset. */
/* ======================================================================== */

// ...
```

### Do Not Use States For "Transient" Events

States should represent "states" the devices can in for a non-zero amount of time. In general, do not create states for things where you only run things on entry to that state and immediately transition away. States should always have a run function that looks for a particular event before transitioning to a different state.

### Use A root State To Perform Actions That Would Apply In Any State

Most of my state machines end up needing a `root` state to capture events and perform actions that would apply in any state. For example, you may have an `ERROR` event in which you would want to transition to an error state, no matter what state you are in. Be aware however that this would also mean that you would re-enter the error state if the error event occurred when already in the error state. If you don't want this to happen, make sure to add a handler for the `ERROR` event in the error state and call `smf_set_handled()` to prevent event propagation.

## Don't Pack Too Much Into A Single State Machine

It can be a bad idea to write all of your code in a single state machine. As the state machine grows in complexity, it can become difficult to understand and maintain.

Furthermore, many concepts when writing software are orthogonal to one another and should be managed in separate state machines. For example, consider a state machine with states `LIGHT_1_ON` and `LIGHT_1_OFF`. You then add a second light and add two child states, `LIGHT_2_ON`, and `LIGHT_2_OFF` to `LIGHT_1_ON`. You realize you also need to handle the 2nd light when the first light is off, so you again and add two child states, `LIGHT_2_ON` and `LIGHT_2_OFF` to `LIGHT_1_OFF`. You might start to see here that this is generally not a good design pattern, as the number of states will grow multiplicatively with the number of lights. Instead, you should probably just create two separate state machines, one for each light. If they need to be coordinated, you can use a event system to send events between the two state machines.

## Event System

The Zephyr SMF does not provide an event system, so you will normally want to implement one yourself. This is a good thing, since if allows flexibility for the many different ways applications can be designed.

## Working Examples

For a full working example of the SMF that runs on Linux (the `native_sim` board), see the GitHub repo [gbmhunter / zephyr-examples](https://github.com/gbmhunter/zephyr-examples/tree/main/apps/state-machine-framework).
