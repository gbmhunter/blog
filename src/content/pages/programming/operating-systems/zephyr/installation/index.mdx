Below are some basic Zephyr installation guides for various OSes. Another good read is the official [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html).

## Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install west
```

We are not going to now run west init, as it will put zephyr in the project root directory. I prefer to keep all west managed dependencies in a single sub-directory so that it keeps the project root directory clean and is easy to setup `.gitignore` rules for.

Let's create a directory called `.west`, add a file called `config` with the contents:

```title=".west/config"
[manifest]
path = app
file = west.yml

[build]
cmake-args = -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DBOARD_ROOT=../

[zephyr]
base = external/zephyr
```

The `base = external/zephyr` will tell west to look for the zephyr source code in the `external/zephyr` directory. All of the other dependencies that are pulled down when you run `west update` will also go in the `external` directory alongside the `zephyr` directory.

Create a `app` directory, and then create a `west.yml` file in it with the following contents:

```title="app/west.yml"
manifest:
  self:
    path: app
  remotes:
    - name: nrf
      url-base: https://github.com/nrfconnect
  projects:
    - name: sdk-nrf
      remote: nrf
      path: nrf
      revision: v3.0.1
      import:
        path-prefix: external
      clone-depth: 1
```

Now we can run `west update` to pull down all the required dependencies. This command will take some time (5-15mins) to complete.

Now update the Python dependencies:

```bash
west packages pip --install
```

## Older Guide

I think this applied Zephyr prior to v4. In `v4` they added commands such as `west sdk install` and `west packages pip --install` to make installation easier.

### Windows

The easiest way to install Zephyr on Windows is to use the chocolatey package manager. Once that is installed, run the following steps from an elevated command prompt:

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure to use a command-prompt and not PowerShell, as PowerShell does not play nice with the `set` method of defining environment variables.
</Aside>

1. Enable global confirmation so that you don't have to manually confirm the installation of individual programs:

    ```cmd
    > choco feature enable -n allowGlobalConfirmation
    Chocolatey v0.10.15
    Enabled allowGlobalConfirmation
    ```

1. Install Zephyr dependencies:

    ```cmd
    > choco install cmake --installargs 'ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System'
    > choco install ninja gperf python git
    ```

    If you already have some of these packages installed on your machine via means other than chocolatey, it's advisable to remove them from the above command so you don't install them again and have one program shadow/conflict the other.

1. Install the Zephyr command-line tool called `west` (NOTE: I have run into problems using a Python virtual environment, so I install `west` to the OS version of Python, more on this below):

    ```cmd
    > pip install west
    ```

1. Create a new Zephyr project:

    ```cmd
    > west init myproject
    === Initializing in C:\Users\gbmhunter\myproject
    --- Cloning manifest repository from https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr, rev. master
    Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/gbmhunter/myproject/.west/manifest-tmp/.git/

    === Initialized. Now run "west update" inside C:\Users\gbmhunter\zephyrproject.
    ```

    WARNING: I got the following error when trying to use a Python virtual environment rather than the OS Python environment to install west and then run `west init`:

    ```text
    > python -m venv .venv
    > .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    > pip install west
    > west init myproject

    PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: 'C:\\Users\\gbmhunter\\myproject\\.west\\manifest-tmp' -> 'C:\\Users\\gbmhunter\\myproject\\zephyr'
    ```

1. Change into the project directory and run `west update`:

    ```cmd
    > west update
    ```

    This command can take a few minutes to run as it clones a number of repositories into the project directory.

1. Export a Zephyr CMake package to your local CMake user package registry. This allows CMake to automatically find a Zephyr "base":

    ```cmd
    > west zephyr-export
    Zephyr (C:/Users/gbmhunter/zephyrproject/zephyr/share/zephyr-package/cmake)
    has been added to the user package registry in:
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\Zephyr

    ZephyrUnittest (C:/Users/gbmhunter/zephyrproject/zephyr/share/zephyrunittest-package/cmake)
    has been added to the user package registry in:
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\ZephyrUnittest
    ```

1. Download and install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain from https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads. By default it will want to be installed on your system at `C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\10 2020-q4-major>`, but don't let it! Zephyr does not like spaces in the path, so install it to a path which has none. I chose `C:\gnu-arm-embedded-toolchain\10-2020-q4-major\`:

1. Setup environment variables:

    ```cmd
    set ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=gnuarmemb
    set GNUARMEMB_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=C:\gnu-arm-embedded-toolchain\10-2020-q4-major
    ```

1. Install the Python dependencies that Zephyr

1. Build the application! For this example I will be using the ST NUCLEO F070RB development board. Note that you can't build this from the project root directory, first you have to change into the `zephyr` subdirectory:

    ```cmd
    > cd .\zephyr
    > west build -b nucleo_f070rb samples/basic/blinky
    C:\Users\gbmhunter\temp\myproject\zephyr>west build -b nucleo_f070rb samples/basic/blinky
    [121/128] Linking C executable zephyr\zephyr_prebuilt.elf

    [128/128] Linking C executable zephyr\zephyr.elf

            IDT_LIST:          0 GB         2 KB      0.00%
    ```

1. Install OpenOCD from https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases. I extracted the .zip file and then copied the files to `C:\Program Files\OpenOCD\bin`.

1. Flash the application:

    ```cmd
    west flash
    ```

    NOTE: I got an error when running this:

    ```text
      File "C:\Users\gbmhunter\temp\myproject\zephyr\scripts/west_commands\runners\core.py", line 504, in require
        if shutil.which(program) is None:
      File "C:\Users\gbmhunter\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\lib\shutil.py", line 1365, in which

      File "C:\Users\gbmhunter\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\lib\ntpath.py", line 185, in split
        p = os.fspath(p)
    TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType
    ```

### Ubuntu/WSL

Follow these instructions to setup/install Zephyr on UNIX like systems, including Ubuntu and WSL. Use of `apt` assumes you are running a Debian like system.

1. Firstly, install system dependencies:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends git cmake ninja-build gperf \
      ccache dfu-util device-tree-compiler wget \
      python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-tk python3-wheel xz-utils file \
      make gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev
    ```

1. Next, download the _Zephyr SDK_. The SDK contains toolchains (compilers, linkers, assemblers and other tools such as QEMU and OpenOCD) for all of Zephyr's supported architectures (e.g. `ARM`, `RISCV64`, `x86_64`, `Xtensa`, `aarch64`). Find the release you want from https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/tags (use the latest if you don't otherwise care). The example below uses `v0.16.4` for x86-64 Linux.

    This is downloaded and installed outside of the Zephyr project directory. You only need one copy of this for many Zephyr projects.

    ```sh
    cd ~
    wget https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.16.4/zephyr-sdk-0.16.4_linux-x86_64.tar.xz
    ```

    This file is over 1GB in size, so make sure you have space! There is also a _minimal release_ which doesn't come with all the toolchains, but instead let's you select and download the ones you needed.

    <Aside type="caution">
    Arguably a bit of a naming gaffe, but the Zephyr SDK does not actually contain the Zephyr source code (the Zephyr source code is pulled into the west workspace when you run `west update`). It contains toolchains for all of Zephyr's supported architectures. I would have thought "Zephyr Toolchain" or similar would have been a better name!
    </Aside>

1. Extract the downloaded SDK:

    ```sh
    tar xvf zephyr-sdk-0.16.4_linux-x86_64.tar.xz
    ```

    This will extract the SDK to `~/zephyr-sdk-0.16.4`. You can choose to move it somewhere else if you want. Other common choices include `/opt/` and `/usr/local/`. This is another big operation which might take minutes to complete!

1. Run the Zephyr SDK setup script:

    ```sh
    cd zephyr-sdk-0.16.4
    ./setup.sh
    ```

1. Install `udev` rules, which let's you program most boards as a regular user (serial port permissions):

    ```sh
    sudo cp ~/zephyr-sdk-0.16.4/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/share/openocd/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
    sudo udevadm control --reload
    ```

1. Create a new directory for the Zephyr project and a Python virtual environment in a `.venv` sub-directory:

    ```sh
    mkdir ~/zephyr-project
    cd ~/zephyr-project
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install `west` in the new virtual environment (`west` is a Python package). As long as the virtual environment is activated, this will make `west` available from the command line:

    ```sh
    pip install west
    ```

1. Initialize the west workspace:

    ```sh
    west init .
    ```

    This creates a directory called `.west` inside the current working directory. Inside `.west` another directory called `manifest-tmp`.

1. Update:

    ```sh
    west update
    ```

    `west update` downloads a lot of Git submodules that are present in the project under `./modules/`. This may take a few minutes to complete.

1. Export a Zephyr CMake package:

    ```sh
    west zephyr-export
    ```

    This adds `Zephyr` to the user package registry at `~/.cmake/packages/Zephyr` (which is outside of the project root directory). You should get a message like this:

    ```text
    Zephyr (/home/gbmhunter/zephyr-project/zephyr/share/zephyr-package/cmake)
    has been added to the user package registry in:
    ~/.cmake/packages/Zephyr
    ```

1. Install additional Python dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r ./zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
    ```

1. `cd` into the `zephyr` directory (a sub-directory of the project directory) and build the Blinky sample:

    ```sh
    cd ~/zephyr-project/zephyr
    west build -p auto -b nucleo_f070rb samples/basic/blinky
    ```

1. Make sure the dev. kit is plugged into the computer, and then flash the application onto the dev kit (remember we were using the NUCLEO-F070RB for this example):

    ```sh
    west flash
    ````

<Aside type="note">
Both `west init` and `west update` can take some time to run (2-5mins each).
</Aside>

If you don't have a dev. board, you could always test out Zephyr by building it for Linux.

```sh
west build -p auto -b native_sim samples/basic/blinky
```

The build executable is at `./zephyr/build/zephyr/zephyr.exe` (even though the extension is `.exe`, it is compiled for Linux not Windows). Of course, there is no basic LED we can blink when running on Linux, but it is mocked for us and instead prints to `stdout`:

```sh
~/zephyr-project/zephyr/build/zephyr$ ./zephyr.exe 
*** Booting Zephyr OS build zephyr-v3.5.0-4014-g0d7d39d44172 ***
LED state: OFF
LED state: ON
LED state: OFF
LED state: ON
LED state: OFF
LED state: ON
...
```

## Creating An Application

Once you've followed the installation instructions, you should be able to build and flash _repository_ applications that are contained with the Zephyr repo (e.g. blinky). But what if you want to develop your own application? This is were is pays to understand the three different application types:

* **Repository Application:** An application contained with the Zephyr repository itself (inside the `zephyr/` directory in the workspace you created above). Typically these are example projects under `samples/` like "Hello, world!" and "blinky". In the directory structure below, `hello_world` is a repository application.
    ```text
    zephyr-project/
    ├─── .west/
    │    └─── config
    └─── zephyr/
        ├── arch/
        ├── boards/
        ├── cmake/
        ├── samples/
        │    ├── hello_world/
        │    └── ...
        ├── tests/
        └── ...
    ```
* **Workspace Application:** An application that is within the west workspace, but not within the zephyr repository (`zephyr/`). This is the way I recommended you create an application if you're learning! In the directory structure below, `app` is a workspace application:
    ```text
    <home>/
    ├─── zephyr-project/
    │     ├── .west/
    │     ├── app/
    │     │    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    │     │    ├── prj.conf
    │     │    └── src/
    │     │        └── main.c
    │     ├── zephyr/
    │     ├── bootloader/
    │     ├── modules/
    │     └── ...
    ```
* **Freestanding Application:** An application that is not within the west workspace, i.e. stored somewhere else entirely on your disk. In the directory structure below, `app` is a freestanding application:
    ```text
    <home>/
    ├─── zephyr-project/
    │     ├─── .west/
    │     │    └─── config
    │     ├── zephyr/
    │     ├── bootloader/
    │     ├── modules/
    │     └── ...
    │
    └─── app/
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        ├── prj.conf
        └── src/
            └── main.c
    ```

### Creating a Workspace Application

If you are learning, I'd recommend you start by creating a bare bones workspace application to learn what the core files are for. Create a directory called `app` in the workspace, and then `cd` into it:

```bash
cd ~/zephyr-project
mkdir app
cd app
```

Now create a file called `CMakeLists.txt` with the follow context:

```cmake title="app/CMakeLists.txt"
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0)

find_package(Zephyr)
project(my_zephyr_app)

target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c)
```

Create an empty `prj.conf` inside this `app` directory. It needs to exist, but you don't need anything in it for now.

The last thing you need to create a directory called `src` to store all the source code, and then create a file in it called `main.c` with the following contents.

```c title="app/src/main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>

int main(void) {
    while (1) {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
        k_msleep(1000);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Your basic app is done! Your file structure should look like this:

```text
<home>/
├─── zephyr-project/
│     ├── .west/
│     ├── app/
│     │    ├── CMakeLists.txt
│     │    ├── prj.conf
│     │    └── src/
│     │        └── main.c
│     ├── zephyr/
│     ├── bootloader/
│     ├── modules/
│     └── ...
```

To build and run, first `cd` back into the west workspace at `~/zephyr-project/`. The run this at the command-line:

```bash
west build -b native_sim ./app
west build -t run
```

The first command performs a build, telling west to use the `native_sim` board (runs on Linux) and to build the app located at `./app`. The second command tells west to run it, and you should get output similar to this:

```bash
(.venv) geoff@my-computer:~/zephyr-project$ west build -t run
-- west build: running target run
[1/2] cd /home/geoff/zephyr-project/build && /home/geoff/zephyr-project/build/zephyr/zephyr.exe
*** Booting Zephyr OS build zephyr-v3.5.0-4014-g0d7d39d44172 ***
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
...
```

## Getting VSCode IntelliSense Working

The most effective way of getting VS Code's IntelliSense working well with Zephyr is to use the "compile_commands" method as described below. I've found this to be much more effective than trying to provide include paths.

Add the following to your `.west/config` file:

```
[build]
cmake-args = -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
```

This will tell CMake to always generate a `compile_commands.json` file when building.

Add the following to your `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "App Config",
            "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

This will tell VS Code to use the `compile_commands.json` file for IntelliSense. The above snippet assumes your build directory is `build/`. Change this as needed.

Rebuild your project from scratch. A `compile_commands.json` should be generated in your build directory. Thus will be picked up by VSCode's Intellisense and should fix any include errors you have!

If you are working on multiple apps with one west workspace, you can separate configurations for each. The following example sets up two configurations, one for the application and one for it's ztest unit tests that are in a `tests/` sub-directory, and with a build folder set to `build-tests`:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "App Config",
            "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json"
        },
        {
            "name": "Tests Config",
            "compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build-tests/compile_commands.json"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4,
    "enableConfigurationSquiggles": true
}
```

Once this is added, you can select the active configuration from the right-hand side of the bottom toolbar within VS Code.

Instead of adding to `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`, if you just have one configuration, you can instead add it to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "C_Cpp.default.compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json",
}
```

If you want more info on Zephyr unit tests and IntelliSense, see the [Tests](#tests) section of this page.

## Moving a West Workspace

I haven't had much luck moving a West workspace on Linux. After moving, the `west` executable could not be found (making sure the Python virtual environment was activated).
