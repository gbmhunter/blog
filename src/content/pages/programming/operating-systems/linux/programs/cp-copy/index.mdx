If you want to move or rename files (instead of copying), please checkout the [mv command](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/mv-move).

## Copying A Single File

This is the simplest cp procedure:

```sh
$ cp ~/original_file.txt ~/copied_file.txt
```

## Coping Multiple, Specific Files To A Directory

This can be done with the syntax:

```sh    
$ cp ~/{file1,file2,file3,file4} ~/destination_folder/
```

Note that there must be no spaces between the comma-separated files.
