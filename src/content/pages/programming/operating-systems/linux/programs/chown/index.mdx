<WarningIsNotes />

`chown` is a Linux command-line program that is used to change the owner and group of a file or directory. The syntax is as follows:

```bash
chown [OPTIONS] OWNER[:GROUP] FILE
```

For example, to change the owner of a file to `someuser`, use the following command:

```bash
chown someuser /path/to/file
```

In the above example, a group is not specified, so the group will remain unchanged. To change the group as well, use the following command:

```bash
chown someuser:somegroup /path/to/file
```

To operate recursively on a directory, use the `-R` flag:

```bash
chown -R someuser:somegroup /path/to/directory
```

This recursive option is really useful for when shared files (e.g. a volume) have been written to from inside a Docker container, but you want to modify them from the host machine. Docker images typically run as `root`, so the files will be owned by `root`. You can use `chown` to change the owner of the files to your user.

`sudo` is commonly used in conjunction with `chown` as the standard user does not normally have permissions to change the owner and/or group.
