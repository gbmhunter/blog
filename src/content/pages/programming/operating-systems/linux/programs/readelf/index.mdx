`readelf` is a program for displaying/disassembling information in `.elf` files. It is similar to the `objdump` program, but is more detailed.

## Basic Usage

`readelf` can be run in one of it's common forms by calling `readelf myfile.elf -a` from the terminal. This will print plenty of information to the terminal.
