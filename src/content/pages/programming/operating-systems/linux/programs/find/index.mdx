`find` is a UNIX utility program which searches directory trees for files matching particular patterns.

By default, `find` is recursive. It searches from the specified directory and looks in all sub-directories.

By default, the search pattern uses glob-style pattern matching (not regex). However, regex can be supplied with the `-regex` option (more )

## Find File By Name

A common use case is using `find` to find files which match a specific glob pattern. For example, if you wanted to find all C++ header files (`.hpp`) in the current directory and all subdirectories (remember, `find` is recursive by default), you would use:

```sh
$ find . -name '*.cpp'
```

You have to provide the `*` at the start because find matches against the whole path (it doesn't allow partial matches).

<Aside type="caution">
Always make sure to make the search path **the first argument** to `find`, as `find` is sensitive to the argument order (even with optional arguments!).
</Aside>

## Multiple Patterns

You can provide find with multiple patterns by using the `-o` option.

The following example looks for all files with the `.cpp` or `.hpp` file extension in the current directory.

```sh    
$ find . -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.hpp"
```

## Find In Path

The `-name` option only searches in the filename, but not the path in which the file sits. If you want to find matches against the path, use the `-path` option instead. The following example will find all paths that contain the string `image`:

```sh
$ find . -path '*image*'
```

Note that the path includes the filename, so you'll find matches in the file name also. Replace `-path` with `-ipath` to make the pattern case insensitive.

As far as I know, the `-wholename` option is identical to `-path`. I believe `-path` is more portable, being part of the POSIX 2008 standard.

## Using Regex

You can use the `-regex` flag to use regex search patterns instead of glob. For example, to find all images in your current directory that have a filename made of numbers, you could use:

```sh
$ find . -regex '\./[0-9]+\.jpg'
```

Note that `find` always lists files in the current directory with `./` at the start.

By default, `find` uses emacs style regex, which have different escaping rules than the usual `egrep` regex. Weirdly, on Mac I could not get the `+` operator (match one or more of the proceeding item) to work. I had to add `-E` (the `-E` tells find to use extended regex):

```sh
$ find . -regex '\./[0-9]+\.jpg' -E
```

## Finding Directories

You can restrict `find` to searching just for directories by providing the `-type d` argument:

```sh
$ find . -type d -name "my_dir_name"
```

## Combining With sed

`find`, a program which finds files, lends itself to working well in conjunction with `sed`, a program for modifying the contents of a file.
