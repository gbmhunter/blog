<WarningIsNotes />

**meld** is a graphical software tool that allows the user to compare and merge the differences between files and folders.

It is commonly used when **resolving merge conflicts** between two files with are under a version control system such as git.

## Compare Two Files

The simplest way to run meld is to compare two files with:

```sh   
$ meld file1.c file2.c
```

This will open up the two files in a graphical interface, where you can easily see the differences and merge if required.
