Label printers are useful in electronics work for labelling PCBs, cables, production items and more.

## Printing From Python in Windows

The `pywin32` Python library can be used to print to most label printers on Windows. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pywin32
```

Here is an example of how to print a image to the label printer using the `pywin32` library. In this case I was connected to a Brady M511 label printer.

```python
import datetime
import os
import sys

from PIL import Image, ImageWin
import win32con
import win32print
import win32ui

file_name = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, "test.png")
# Create device context
hDC = win32ui.CreateDC()
hDC.CreatePrinterDC(printer_name)

# Get printer dimensions in device units
printer_width = hDC.GetDeviceCaps(win32con.PHYSICALWIDTH)
printer_height = hDC.GetDeviceCaps(win32con.PHYSICALHEIGHT)

# Open and prepare the image
bmp = Image.open(file_name)

# Calculate scaling factor to fit the image within printer dimensions
# while maintaining aspect ratio
width_ratio = printer_width / bmp.size[0]
height_ratio = printer_height / bmp.size[1]
scale_factor = min(width_ratio, height_ratio)

# Calculate new dimensions
new_width = int(bmp.size[0] * scale_factor)
new_height = int(bmp.size[1] * scale_factor)

# Resize the image
bmp = bmp.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)


# Calculate centering offsets
x_offset = (printer_width - new_width) // 2
y_offset = (printer_height - new_height) // 2

# Start printing
hDC.StartDoc(file_name)
hDC.StartPage()

# Draw the image centered on the page
dib = ImageWin.Dib(bmp)
dib.draw(hDC.GetHandleOutput(), (0, 0, new_width, new_height))

hDC.EndPage()
hDC.EndDoc()
hDC.DeleteDC()
```

`GetDeviceCaps()` can be used to retrieve a number of different properties of the printer. Some of the things you can request are:

* `HORZRES`: Printable area width in pixels
* `VERTRES`: Printable area height in pixels
* `LOGPIXELS`: Dots per inch
* `PHYSICALWIDTH`: Total area width in device units
* `PHYSICALHEIGHT`: Total area height in device units
* `PHYSICALOFFSETX`: Left margin in device units
* `PHYSICALOFFSETY`: Top margin in device units
```

These constants are defined in the `win32con.py` file as part of the `pywin32` library.

```python
import win32con

print(win32con.PHYSICALWIDTH)
```

If you are wanting to change the label size, you need to set the paper width and length attributes. To do this, you need to open the printer with the `ACCESS_MASK` set to `win32print.PRINTER_ALL_ACCESS`:

```python
PRINTER_DEFAULTS = {"DesiredAccess": win32print.PRINTER_ALL_ACCESS}
printer_handle = win32print.OpenPrinter(printer_name, PRINTER_DEFAULTS)
```

Here is an example which set a number of different attributes for a printer.

```python
# PRINTER_ALL_ACCESS is required to set paper size
PRINTER_DEFAULTS = {"DesiredAccess": win32print.PRINTER_ALL_ACCESS}
printer_handle = win32print.OpenPrinter(printer_name, PRINTER_DEFAULTS)

# 2 : A PRINTER_INFO_2 structure containing detailed information about the printer.
# See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/printdocs/setprinter
level = 2
attributes = win32print.GetPrinter(printer_handle, level)
# Width is perpendicular to the label feed direction
# Length is parallel with the label feed direction
# Both of these are in tenths of a millimeter
attributes['pDevMode'].PaperWidth = 90
attributes['pDevMode'].PaperLength = 80

# For printer devices only, selects the size of the paper to print on.
# This member can be set to zero if the length and width of the paper are
# both set by the dmPaperLength and dmPaperWidth members
# (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodea)
attributes['pDevMode'].PaperSize = 0

# Print 2 copies of the label
attributes['pDevMode'].Copies = 2

win32print.SetPrinter(printer_handle, level, attributes, 0)
```

This code example also uses `Copies` to set the number of copies to print. I found this to be more reliable than submitting the print job multiple times.
