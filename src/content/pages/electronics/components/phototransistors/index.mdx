Phototransistors are transistors which can be used to detect light. They are similar to photodiodes, but are more sensitive (i.e. have a higher output current for a given amount of light). Their downside is that they have a slower response time compared to photodiodes.

The purple looking lens of a) is a good indicator that the phototransistor operates in the infrared spectrum (these lenses filter out visible light).</Image>

## Schematic Symbol

The basic phototransistor schematic symbol is shown below:

## How They Work

A phototransistor is a [BJT](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts/) but with the base driven from a light-sensitive photodiode rather than electrically from another part of the circuit.



## Applications

Phototransistors are used in a variety of applications, including:

* [Optical isolators (optocouplers)](/electronics/components/optical-isolators/): They are a core component in a optocoupler, used on the receiving side to detect the light emitted by the LED on the transmitting side.
