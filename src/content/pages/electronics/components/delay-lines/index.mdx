<WarningIsNotes />

Delay lines are digital ICs which can delay a digital signal by a certain amount of time. They are used for a number of applications, including:

- Signal delay
- HSYNC pulse generation in LCD displays[^analog-devices-ds1124-product-page]

## How They Work

Most delay ICs work by using a chain of inverter gates, along with advanced circuitry to compensate for voltage and temperature variations and keep the delays accurate[^analog-devices-how-delay-lines-work]. <IRef iref="fig-ds1135-internal-circuitry" /> shows the internal circuitry of the Analog Devices DS1135 "3-in-1 Delay Line" IC[^analog-devices-how-delay-lines-work].

Delay lines usually have multiple output pins, each which is connected to a different point in the delay sequence. These are called _taps_. The number of taps is an important parameter of the delay line[^analog-devices-ds1110l-ds].

Delay until first tap, and the incremental delay are also important parameters.
