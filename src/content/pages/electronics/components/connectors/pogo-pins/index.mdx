They are commonly used in:

* Between PCB connections in a multi-board assembly (e.g. PCB stack). Although usually your first choice for this application would be mezzanine connectors and/or standard header style connectors.
* Wireless ear buds, to make electrical contact with the base unit for charging.
* [Test jigs](/pcb-design/test-jigs/) to make electrical contact with a PCB during testing.
