RF connectors are connectors specifically designed to carry high-frequency signals, typically in the 100MHz-30GHz range.

## BNC Connectors

BNC (_Bayonet Neill-Concelman_) connectors are quick connect connectors designed for RF signals. It is named after it's **B**ayonet locking mechanism and it's inventors, Paul **N**eill and Carl **C**oncelman. It is "standardized" in MIL-STD-348A[^everyspec-mil-std-348a].

### Specifications

* **Passband:** 0-4GHz
* **Impedance:** $50\,\Omega$ (standard) or $75\,\Omega$ (video).

### Uses 

They were originally designed for military use, but are now commonly used for a variety of RF applications including:

* **Oscilloscope probes:** Used for lower frequency oscilloscope probes (0-200MHz). The top-end modern oscilloscopes tend to have proprietary connections to the probes, with added pins for extra functionality.
* **Analog video signals**
* **Radio antennas**

The USSR version of the BNC connector is called the SR connector. However, the connector dimensions are slightly different due to the conversion from imperial to metric. The SR connectors can be mated with BNC connectors, although sometimes it requires a decent amount of force.

## U.FL

Also known as UMC or XFL connectors.

### Schematic Symbol

There is no "standard" schematic symbol for the male, SMD mount UFL connector, so I normally decide to go with some that is visually resembles the actual connector part, as shown below:

The height of the male SMD connector can vary, but something around 1.2mm is common.

## SMA Connectors

SMA (SubMiniature version A) connectors are small (although probably medium-sized by today's standards) $50\,\Omega$ RF coaxial connectors with a screw-style connection mechanism. The gender name refers to the innermost electrical component (e.g. a male SMA connector has the pin in the middle, whilst the female has the socket to accept the pin). They typically have a passband between $0-16\,GHz$, although some specialized versions extends in the $30{+}\,GHz$ territory[^amphenolrf-sma].

The original SMA connectors were developed in the 1960s[^reichelt-sma-rpsma].

* Standard Male SMA connector: Central **0.9 mm diameter pin** surrounded by a barrel with **inside** threads.
* Standard Female SMA connector: Central **sleeve** (made from the di-electric) surrounded by a barrel with **outside** threads.

### Reverse-polarity and Reverse-thread SMA Connectors

Be wary, there are two additional variations (aside from the normal SMA connector) of SMA connectors which are hard to recognise on first glance.

_Reverse-polarity_ (RP) SMA connectors have the pin and sleeve swapped between the male and female parts. Also known as _RP-SMA_ or _R-SMA_. _Reverse-polarity_ was designed  to prevent the unauthorized connection of a antenna with a larger gain to WiFi equipment[^reichelt-sma-rpsma], to distinguish them from cellular equipment involving LTE/GSM/UMTS which was utilizing the standard SMA connector. These days, RP-SMA connectors are now commonplace, somewhat defeating the protection through obscurity. However in general, standard SMA connectors are still used for cellular applications whilst RP-SMA for WiFi/WLAN.

There are also _reverse-thread_ (RT) SMA connectors which have the threads in the opposite direction to the standard SMA connectors. One such example is the Pasternack "RT SMA Male Connector Crimp/Solder Attachment for RG55, RG141, RG142, RG223, RG400"[^pasternack-rt-sma-male-connector].

## N Connectors

_N connectors_ (a.k.a. N-type or Type N connectors) are large RF connectors.
