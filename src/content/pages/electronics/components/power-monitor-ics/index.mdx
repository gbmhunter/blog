Power monitor ICs are integrated circuits that typically are used to measure mains power (e.g. 110VAC, 230VAC) in an isolated manner and provide digital outputs to a microcontroller. <IRef iref="allegro-acs37800-typical-application" /> shows a typical application diagram of a power monitor IC.

## Examples

### Allegro ACS37800

The Allegro ACS37800 contains a [hall-effect sensor](/electronics/components/sensors/hall-effect) which is used to measure the AC mains current in an isolated manner.

> These features enable isolated current sending without expensive Rogowski coils, oversized current transformers, isolated operational amplifiers, or the power loss of shunt resistors. - Excerpt from the Allegro ACS37800 datasheet.[^allegro-acs37800-ds]
