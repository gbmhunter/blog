<WarningIsNotes />

On/off controllers are ICs which are designed to control the power state of a device, typically from a push button or similar user input.

<Aside type="tip">
On/off controllers can also refer to completely different thing -- an industrial system control method in where the output is turned either fully on of off based on whether the process value is above or below a certain setpoint. This is related to [PID control](/programming/general/pid-control/).
</Aside>

They are commonly interfaced into devices with [microcontrollers](/programming/microcontrollers/) and other products running programmable systems (e.g. FPGAs). Even if a microcontroller that is capable of low-power sleep is being used in the device, they are still often added to a design as a back-up in case the microcontroller freezes or becomes otherwise unresponsive. This is the approach used in many desktop and laptop computers to force a hard off. If the power button is pressed for a short period, the software tried to shutdown the computer gracefully. If the software does not respond, the user can hold the power button down for a longer period to force a hard off, which is done by an on/off controller (or similar).

## Example ICs

### STM6600/STM6601

The STM6600/STM6601 are on/off controller ICs made by STMicroelectronics. They call the push-button reset feature "smart reset", and requires two push-button switches to be held on at the same time for a certain time period for a reset to occur[^st-on-off-controllers].

### LTC2954

The LTC2954 is a push-button on/off controller from Analog Devices. It has a wide input voltage range of 2.7V to 26.4V. It comes in 3x2mm [DFN](/pcb-design/component-packages/dfn-component-package/) and ThinSOT packages[^analog-devices-ltc2954-ds].
