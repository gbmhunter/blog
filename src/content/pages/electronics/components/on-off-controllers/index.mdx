<WarningIsNotes />

On/off controllers are ICs which are designed to control the power state of a device, typically from a push button or similar user input.

Even if a microcontroller that is capable of low-power sleep is being used in the device, they are still often added to a design as a back-up in case the microcontroller freezes or becomes otherwise unresponsive. This is the approach used in many desktop and laptop computers to force a hard off. If the power button is pressed for a short period, the software tried to shutdown the computer gracefully. If the software does not respond, the user can hold the power button down for a longer period to force a hard off, which is done by an on/off controller (or similar).
