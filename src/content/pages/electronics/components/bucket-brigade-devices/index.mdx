<WarningIsNotes />

Bucket brigade devices (BBDs, a.k.a. bucket brigades) are analogue delay ICs that "shunt" charge along a series of switched [capacitors](/electronics/components/capacitors/) to create a delay. <IRef iref="fig-bucket-brigade-delay-basic-internal-schematic" /> shows a basic internal schematic of a bucket brigade device.

<IRef iref="fig-bucket-brigade-delay-basic-internal-schematic" /> was the initial design, but is suffered from a few problems, the most serious being poor transfer efficiency[^bbds-circa-1977].

Bucket brigades are analogue in amplitude, but discrete (digital) in time. Thus they suffer from the same aliasing issues all other digital sampling methods do. Care must be taken to ensure the input signal has no frequencies above half the sampling rate to avoid aliasing. This is typically done with an analogue low-pass "anti-aliasing" filter. Second-order [Sallen-Key filters](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/sallen-key-filters/) are a common choice due to their effectiveness and simplicity.

## History

The bucket brigade in it's integrated form was first invented by F.L.J. Sangster at Phillips in 1968[^bbds-circa-1977] [^ethw-flj-sangster].
