description: Coin cell batteries (a.k.a. buttons cells or watch batteries) are a small, low energy and low power battery that can power small devices. They are commonly used in small, low-power consumer electronics such as calculators, remotes, and key fobs. They are also fitted to PCBs as backup batteries for things like real-time clocks (RTCs).

### Overview

Button cells are also known as coin cells or watch batteries.

## Polarity

The insulated top cap of a button cell is the negative terminal, the base is the positive terminal.

## Internal Resistance

The internal resistance of a coin cell battery starts of at a rather large 10Î©. This then rapidly increases as the batteries energy is consumed. Where high pulse currents are needed, coin cell batteries can be used in conjunction with high-valued capacitors.

A rule of thumb for coin cell batteries is that 10mA is the maximum current draw.

## Technologies

### Silver Cell

Silver cells have a very stable output voltage over the lifespan of the battery.

## Common Types

CR2032. CR2025.

## PCB Mounting

Coin cells are commonly used as backup batteries for real-time clocks (RTCs) on circuit boards. There are many PCB mount coin cell battery holders available on the market. <IRef iref="fig-pcb-mount-cr1632-coin-cell-battery-holder" /> shows a horizontal PCB mount CR1632 coin cell battery holder. You can also find vertical mount versions which don't take up as much component area on the PCB at the expense of being taller.

## Dangers To Children

Coin cells are very dangerous to children if swallowed. They can cause severe internal burns due to the chemicals inside of them. Some coin cells have a bitter coating to help prevent children swallowing them, as shown in the below image:

The Duracell coin batteries use non-toxic Bitrex (which is commonly used on other household products such as anti-nail biting solutions) as the bitter substance[^duracell-power-safer].

According to Duracell, the most dangerous sizes are:

* 2016
* 2025
* 2032

(i.e. all the button cells with a 20mm diameter)[^duracell-power-safer].
