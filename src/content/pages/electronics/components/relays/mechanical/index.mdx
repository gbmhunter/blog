Mechanical relays are electronic components which can switch a load on and off from an isolated control signal using an electromagnet and contactors.

Relays are used for things such as:

* Turing on mains voltage devices from 5-12V circuits, while providing isolation
* Switching large currents
* Providing isolation between two circuits (although opto-couplers are normally used for this)

Relays can also come packaged with other functionality such as built-in timers.

## Terminology/Parameters

* The Coil: The windings which turn the relay on when you apply a voltage
* The Contacts: The output pins when get connected or disconnected when the relay turns on
* Rated Coil Voltage: The recommended voltage that should be applied to the coil to turn the relay on.
* Rated Coil Current: The current the relay coil will draw when the rated coil voltage is applied to it.
* Contact Current Rating: The maximum current that the relay can conduct through the contacts

## Contact Arrangements

* **Normally open (NO):** Contacts which are open-circuit when the coil is not energized, and become short-circuit to common when the coil is energized.
* **Normally open (NO):** Contacts which are short-circuit to common when the coil is not energized, and become open-circuit when the coil is energized.

Single-pole, single-throw (1A)

Double-pole, single-throw (1C)

## Dry Contacts

It is common in the electrical industry to refer to "wet" or "dry" contacts. In the context of relays, "dry contacts" are normally used. This is when the relay does not provide electrical power to the output contacts. The relay simply switches the contacts together, in the same way a mechanical switch would. It is up to the external circuitry to provide the power to the load. As shown in <IRef iref="fig-dry-contacts-relay-schematic" />, one contact could be connected to 240VAC (or any other voltage), and the other contact to the live of an external load (which already has a neutral connected to it). When the relay is activated, the contacts will be connected together.

It is not clear to me what a "wet" relay contact would be. Potentially this would be if one contact of a NO pair was permanently connected to 240VAC (and not connected to the outside world), with the other contact being available to connect to an external load. When the relay is activated, the available contact would be "energized" to 240VAC and power the load.

## Inductive Kickback and Flyback Diodes

The coil of a relay is basically an [inductor](/electronics/components/inductors/). Due to the rapid $\frac{di}{dt}$ when the relay is switched off, the inductive coil will generate a large negative voltage to try and keep the current flowing (remember: inductors "resist" the change in current). This is called _inductive kickback_. This voltage spike can cause havoc in neighbouring components (e.g. killing the transistor used to switch the relay on, or arcing across switch terminals) if not suppressed. A _flyback_ diode in anti-parallel across the coil of the relay will clamp the voltage spike to approx. no more than $-0.7V$.

<Image src={import('./_assets/flyback-diode-relay-schematic.svg')} width="500px">Always add a \"flyback\" diode in anti-parallel across the coil of a relay to quench voltage spikes due the rapid di/dt through the inductor when the relay is switched of. </Image>

However, there are some drawbacks to using basic flyback diodes. On relay switch-off, the flyback diode decays the magnetic field of the coil far more slowly than if there was no flyback diode protection present. This causes the relay to take longer for the "clapper type" relay contacts to open. When relay contacts open, small "microwelds" occurs at the contact interface. Usually, the contacts are moving apart with enough force/velocity that these welds are easily broken. However, the slower open time with a flyback diode can cause the relay to "stick" -- this is when the contacts become welded together and do not open[^bib-te-coil-suppression-relay-life][^bib-relay-tech-info].

The solution? Add a Zener diode in series with the general purpose diode to increase the voltage drop when the coil is turning off. This causes the magnetic field to collapse faster (closer to an open-circuit), but still provides circuit protection. Choose a Zener voltage so that the Zener voltage plus forward diode drop does not exceed the maximum voltage of the switching element (or other circuitry).

## Latching

With a little external componentry, a mechanical relay can be made to latch-on after triggered, and will only reset once a reset button has been pushed (or power disconnected).

## Common Relay Packages

Most PCB-mount relays have an asymmetric lead configuration so that it cannot be installed incorrectly.

You can get DIN mounted relay "sockets" for mounting relays onto DIN rail, as shown below:
