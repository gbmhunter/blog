A vacuum tube is a device which controls a electric current through a vacuum created by a sealed container.

Although none were "used" in the [Columbus Radio project](/electronics/projects/columbus-radio), the radio itself still had some beautiful valves in it (which I left in even though the valve circuitry is not used).
