_Power management ICs_ (PMICs) are integrated circuits that are used to manage power in a circuit. They are commonly used to manage power on small devices which contain rechargeable battery power. They may contain power regulation circuitry such as linear regulators or buck/boost converters. 

## Examples

### Nordic Semiconductor nPM1100

The nPM1100 by Nordic Semiconductor is a PMIC which can manage power for a device that contains a Li-ion battery which is rechargeable via USB. It is aimed to work in low-power devices (1-50 uA average current) with a MCU from the nRF range (but can just as easily work with any other downstream device).

It can charge the battery from USB with a configurable charge current from 20 mA to 400 mA, and supply up to 150 mA to the downstream devices. It contains a buck converter which is efficient down to 1 uA loads (it can automatically switch between PWM and hysteretic operation modes). Typical quiescent current is 800 uA.[^nordic-semi-npm1100-product-spec]

There are three known errata for revision 2 of the nPM1100 IC:[^nordic-semi-npm1100-errata]

- Inserting USB causes VSYS voltage to undershoot in some cases.
- Battery charging gets stuck if battery pack over discharge protection is active when USB is connected.
- Battery charging gets stuck in some cases if battery pack contains a PCM (Protection Circuit Module) which adds an additional diode voltage drop when over discharge protection is active.
