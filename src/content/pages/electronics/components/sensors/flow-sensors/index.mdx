Flow sensors are sensors that measure the flow rate of a fluid or gas. They are used in a wide range of applications, from measuring the flow of water in a pipe to monitoring the flow of air in an engine.

There are many different physical principles that can be used to measure flow rate. Some common types of flow sensors are:

* Hall effect based flow sensors: These sensors use a impeller with a magnet and a hall effect sensor to detect a rotation of the impeller.
* Ultrasonic flow sensors:
* Thermal mass flow sensors: They combine a heater element and a temperature sensor, and measure the amount of energy absorbed by the fluid as it passes over the heater.
* Differential pressure flow sensors: These utilize the Bernoulli principle to measure the pressure drop across an obstruction as the fluid flows through it.

## Hall Effect Flow Sensors

### Examples

#### YF-Bx

YF-Bx is a family of hall effect based flow sensors mounted in a small piece of 1" brass tubing. It can measure flow rates between 1 and 25 L/min.

## Tiny Flow Sensors

Tiny flow sensors exist in chip-size packages. These are in a group of products called MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) devices.

Sensirion makes small 10x10mm liquid flow sensors (the LPP10 and LPG10). They are based on thermal MEMs elements. They can measure between 0 and 1000uL/min (1mL/min), with a resolution that can be as low as 0.5nL/min. It has a response time 40ms/sample. It is compatible with H20, methanol, ethanol, and blood.
