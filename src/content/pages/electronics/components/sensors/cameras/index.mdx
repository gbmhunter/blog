Cameras are devices that capture images/video and convert them into an analogue or digital signal.

## IP Cameras

IP cameras are cameras that are connected to a network and can be accessed via a IP address. Many of them support PoE, allowing a single cable to both power the camera and provide a network connection.

ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) is an popular standard that IP cameras can support.
