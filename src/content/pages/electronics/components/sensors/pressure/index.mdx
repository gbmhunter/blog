Pressure sensors measure the pressure of a fluid or gas.

## Examples

### Honeywell ABP2 Series

The Honeywell ABP2 series is a family of board-mount pressure sensors. There are both through-hole and SMD versions. They detect pressure using piezoresistive silicon and offer both analogue and digital output options (digital versions support either the [I2C](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol) or [SPI](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol) bus protocols). Options exist to both measure gas and liquid (there is an additional gel coating added to the liquid versions).[^honeywell-abp2-product-page]

You have to be careful when both soldering and handling these sensors. They are particularly sensitive to over-heating (the plastic parts and/or sealant can melt) during soldering. The plastic barb can also be torn of the rest of the component easily it too much torque/force is applied from the connected hose.
