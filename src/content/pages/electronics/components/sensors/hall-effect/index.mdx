## Current Detection

Hall-effect sensors can also be used for current detection. One example is the Allegro ACS37800 power monitor IC. This IC contains a hall-effect sensor which is used to measure the AC mains current in an isolated manner.

> These features enable isolated current sending without expensive Rogowski coils, oversized current transformers, isolated operational amplifiers, or the power loss of shunt resistors. - Excerpt from the Allegro ACS37800 datasheet.[^allegro-acs37800-ds]
