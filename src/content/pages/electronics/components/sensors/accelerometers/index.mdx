<WarningIsNotes />

Accelerometers are MEMS (micro electro-mechanical devices) that measure their acceleration. They are normally 3-axis devices that return a reading for the x, y and z axis accelerations.

See the [IMU page](/electronics/components/sensors/inertial-measurement-units-imus) for monolithic components which include accelerometers with other MEMS sensors.

## PCB Mounting

Like gyroscopes and magnetometers, accelerometers have to be orientated precisely on a PCB to return accurate readings. Luckily, most SMD packages used these days for accelerometers (such as the QFN and LGA package) have nice self-aligning properties during the reflow soldering process (due to the surface tension of the solder paste).

## Examples

### ST Microelectronics LIS2DH12

The ST Microelectronics LIS2DH12 is a "ultra-low power" 3-axis accelerometer. It's unique selling point is that it can consume just 2 uA of current at 2.5V with a 1 Hz sampling rate. It has ±2g/±4g/±8g/16g selectable full scale ranges and can communicate via SPI or I2C interface. It is available in a LGA-12 package.[^st-microelectronics-lis2dh12-datasheet]
