Accelerometers are that measure their acceleration.

Many IC based accelerators are MEMS (micro electro-mechanical devices). These are normally 3-axis devices that return a reading for the x, y and z axis accelerations.

See the [IMU page](/electronics/components/sensors/inertial-measurement-units-imus) for monolithic components which include accelerometers with other MEMS sensors.

## Spring Accelerometers

A soft spring with a metal rod going through the middle of it can act as a really basic accelerometer. These are often called vibration or shock sensors. Then the device is subject to enough acceleration in a direction perpendicular to the spring axis, the spring will bend enough to make contact with the conductive rod and close the circuit.

## MEMS Accelerometers

They way MEMS sensors are constructed is quite interesting. Here is a description of the internal MEMS sensor from the ST Microelectronics LIS2DH12 datasheet:

> A proprietary process is used to create a surface micromachined accelerometer. The
technology processes suspended silicon structures which are attached to the substrate in a
few points called anchors and are free to move in the direction of the sensed acceleration.
To be compatible with traditional packaging techniques, a cap is placed on top of the
sensing element to avoid blocking the moving parts during the molding phase of the plastic
encapsulation.
>
> When an acceleration is applied to the sensor, the proof mass displaces from its nominal
position, causing an imbalance in the capacitive half-bridge. This imbalance is measured
using charge integration in response to a voltage pulse applied to the capacitor.
At steady state the nominal value of the capacitors are a few pF and when an acceleration is
applied, the maximum variation of the capacitive load is in the fF range. -- ST Microelectronics LIS2DH12 datasheet[^st-microelectronics-lis2dh12-datasheet]:

## PCB Mounting

Like gyroscopes and magnetometers, accelerometers have to be orientated precisely on a PCB to return accurate readings. Luckily, most SMD packages used these days for accelerometers (such as the QFN and LGA package) have nice self-aligning properties during the reflow soldering process (partly due to the surface tension of the solder paste).

## Examples

### ST Microelectronics LIS2DH12

The ST Microelectronics LIS2DH12 is a "ultra-low power" 3-axis accelerometer. It's unique selling point is that it can consume just 2 uA of current at 2.5V with a 1 Hz sampling rate. It has ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g selectable full scale ranges and can communicate via a [SPI](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/) or [I2C](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/) interface. It is available in a LGA-12 package.[^st-microelectronics-lis2dh12-datasheet]

The datasheet for the LIS2DH12 does not describe how the various interrupt types (e.g. `THRESHOLD_1`, `THRESHOLD_2`, and `CLICK`) work. Better descriptions can be found in the [LIS3DH: MEMS digital output motion sensor ultra-low-power high-performance 3-axis “nano” accelerometer](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/cd00290365.pdf) application note.[^st-microelectronics-lis3dh-application-note] The `CLICK` detection works by looking for acceleration that goes above a certain threshold then drops again within a specified time window. There is support for "single" click and "double" click detection.

The LIS2DH12 also has a high-pass filter which can be used to remove the DC component of the signal. This can be useful to remove the effects of gravity. It has a adjustable cutoff frequency which can be set from 0.002 to 100 Hz depending on the register configuration and the sampling rate.[^st-microelectronics-lis3dh-application-note]
