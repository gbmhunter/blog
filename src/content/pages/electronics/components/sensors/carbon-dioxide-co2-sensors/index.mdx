<WarningIsNotes />

The primary method for detecting carbon dioxide (CO2) is to use infrared gas sensors (NDIR). Chemical sensing is another method for detecting CO2. [CO2meter.com](http://www.co2meter.com/) sells a range of CO2 sensors, and provides support to connect them easily to an Arduino ([see here for a UART example](http://www.co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN126-K3x-sensor-arduino-uart.pdf)).
