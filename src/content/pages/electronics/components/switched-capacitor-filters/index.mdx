<WarningIsNotes />

_Switched-capacitor filters_ are IC components which **provide analogue filtering by switching (connecting and disconnecting) capacitors**.

They are an alternative to passive RC circuits, with the following advantages:

* You can build **higher-order filters** with less components.
* You can easily change the **cut-off frequency** by varying the clock frequency.

They have the following disadvantages compared to passive RC filters:

* They are generally **noisier**, introducing noise at the switching frequency and it's harmonics (clock feedthru)[^bib-linear-tech-mystery-switched-capacitor].
* They sample the input, and thus are **subject to aliasing**. Care must be taken that there are no frequencies in the input higher than half the clock frequency[^bib-libretext-switched-capacitor-filters].

The cut-off frequency of a switched-capacitor circuit depends on the ratio of the capacitances, and not their absolute values. Generally, the ratio of two capacitors can be more tightly controlled than their absolute values (especially in IC design). Furthermore, IC technology allows capacitor ratios to be much made much easier than resistor ratios[^bib-linear-tech-mystery-switched-capacitor].

One of the biggest uses for a switched-capacitor filters is as an anti-aliasing filter before an [ADC](/electronics/components/analogue-to-digital-converters-adcs/)[^bib-linear-tech-mystery-switched-capacitor]. The filter would be configured as a low-pass filter to limit the input signal frequencies to at least half the sampling rate of the ADC to prevent aliasing.

## Topologies

Most universal switched-capacitor filter ICs are arranged in the state-variable-biquad configuration, which allows for the creation of low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, all-pass and notch filters. It also allows for the design of high-Q filters with relatively low dependence on component tolerances[^bib-linear-tech-mystery-switched-capacitor].

## Clock Feedthrough

_Clock feedthrough_ (or clock feedthru) is the RMS value of the clock frequency and it's harmonics which are injected into the output of a switched-capacitor filter[^bib-analog-devices-ltc-1068-ds]. Clock feedthrough is typically tested with the input of the filter grounded.

## Simulation

Unfortunately, due to limitations in the way SPICE engines are designed, the frequency response of switched-capacitor circuits cannot be directly simulated using the classic "AC analysis" method[^bib-biolek-ac-analysis-switched-capacitor]. You can however run transient analysis at specific switching frequencies to find the gain -- you can then repeat this at different switching frequencies using scripting abilities if available.

The paper [AC analysis of switched capacitor filters in SPICE-family programs by Dalibor Biolek et al](http://kit2015.aos.sk/proceedings/pdf/kolka.pdf) describes methods of creating equivalent models in SPICE programs that do allow you to perform direct AC analysis[^bib-biolek-ac-analysis-switched-capacitor].

## Popular ICs

### MF10

The _MF10_ is a dual 2nd order, state variable, switched-capacitor filter[^bib-maxim-mf10-ds]. It has been produced by companies such as National Semiconductor, Maxim and Texas Instruments under variations of the `MF10` part number.

Texas Instruments has in active production the `MF-10N`, which is an equivalent IC in a [SOIC-20 package](/pcb-design/component-packages/soic-component-package/). However, they recommend the LMF100 which is pin-compatible and has improved performance[^bib-ti-mf10-n-ds].

### LTC1068

With 4x 2nd-order filters, the LTC1068 allows you to make up to 1x 8th order filter[^bib-analog-devices-ltc-1068-ds].
