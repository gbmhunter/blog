Resonant converters include ZVS (zero voltage switching) and ZCS (zero current switching) resonant converters.

## Resonant LLC Converters

_Resonant LLC converters_ are a topology of switch-mode power supply (SMPS) that use two inductors (LL) and one capacitor (C) in a resonant circuit (along with switches, transformers, a controller and more) to transform voltage and current. Compared to other SMPS topologies, they offer high efficiency (93-95% is common) due to ZCS (zero current switching) and ZVS (zero voltage switching) capabilities which reduce the switching losses.

Leakage inductance from the transformer is used as one of the L's in the resonant tank[^infineon-half-bridge-and-llc-controller].
