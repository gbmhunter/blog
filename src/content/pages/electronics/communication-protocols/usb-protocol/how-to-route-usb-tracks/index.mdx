title: How To Route USB Tracks
type: page
---

The D+ and D- (data) USB traces on circuit boards require impedance controlled routing. The tolerance depends on the exact USB standard used (e.g. USB1.0, USB2.0 full-speed/high-speed, USB3.0).

The USB2.0 spec specifies a 90R differential impedance and a 45R single-ended impedance for the D+ and D- data lines.

For most normal sized PCBs, signal integrity starts becoming an issue at the 480Mb/s USB baud rate.

I recommend visiting the [Transmission Lines page](/electronics/circuit-design/transmission-lines/) before continuing here...

## What Is My Bandwidth?

Lets recall the well-known rule-of-thumb:


$$
\begin{align}
BW \approx \frac{0.35}{t_r}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">    where:<br/>
    $ t_r $ is the maximum rise time from 10 to 90% (this is stated in the USB spec.), in seconds (s).<br/>  
    $ BW $ the resulting maximum bandwidth the track has to support, in Hertz (Hz). You can also think of this as a maximum frequency, since the bandwidth starts at 0Hz.<br/></p>

The USB specification states a maximum rise time of 4ns. Using the equation above, this gives us a bandwidth of approximately 87.5MHz. 

From this, we can calculate the wavelength of an 87.5MHz signal travelling down a track on standard FR-4 PCB.

$$
\begin{align}
\lambda = \frac{c}{f\sqrt{\epsilon_r}}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">    where:<br/>
    $ c $ is the speed of light, in meters per second<br/>
    $  f $ is the frequency that you worked out above (which we called bandwidth)<br/>
    $ \epsilon_r $ is the di-electric of the material the electro-magnetic wave is travelling through, and is unitless. In our case this will be the di-electric of the PCB. For standard FR4, this is about 4.35.<br/></p>

> Another general rule-of-thumb is that the impedance of a PCB track is not important if it is at least 10 times smaller than the wavelength of the signal.

Thus, the minimum wavelength of the USB full-speed signal is 1.65m, and the characteristic impedance of the track is only important if the total track length is greater than 165mm.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>USB Standard</th>
      <th>Minimum Rise Time, $ t_r $</th>
      <th>Track Length At Which Impedance Matters</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
<td>2.0 Low-speed (1.5Mb/s)</td>
<td >75ns (USB Spec Rev 2.0, Table 7-10)</td>
<td >3.1m</td>
</tr><tr >
<td >2.0 Full-speed (12Mb/s)</td>
<td >4ns (USB Spec Rev 2.0, Table 7-9)</td>
<td >165mm</td>
</tr><tr >
<td>2.0 High-speed (480Mb/s)</td>
<td>500ps (USB Spec Rev 2.0, Table 7-8)</td>
<td>20.5mm</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

As you can see from the above table, for most PCBs designs, you don't really have to worry about USB2.0 low-speed tracks, you might be concerned about really long USB2.0 full-speed tracks, and you have to control the impedance for all but the smallest USB2.0 high-speed tracks.

For more information, see the [Transmission Lines page](/electronics/circuit-design/transmission-lines/).

## What Should My Impedance Be?

The impedance depends on the USB standard.
