Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data over a distance of a few centimetres.

All NFC communication is based on the ISO/IEC 18092 standard.

The [nRF52 series MCUs](/programming/microcontrollers/nordic/nrf52/) have a near field communication tag peripheral called `NFCT`. This peripheral can be used to implement an NFC tag. It supports NFC-A listen mode operation at 13.56MHz and a bitrate of 106kbps.[^nordic-semi-nrf52840-datasheet]

## NDEF

NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) is a standard for exchanging data between NFC devices. It is a binary format structured in messages. Each message can contain one or more records. Each record contains metadata (e.g. record type, length) and the payload.[^oreilly-beginning-nfc]
