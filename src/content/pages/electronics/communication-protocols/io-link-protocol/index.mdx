The IO-Link protocol is a point-to-point serial communication protocol which is commonly used for sensor and actuator communication in an industrial environment.

## Packet Types

### Process Data

### Service Data

Service data is used to send large amounts of non-periodic data at the request of the recipient. 

### Events

Events are unsolicited messages that convey information such as alarm status or info.
