RS-232 is a digital data transmission protocol with origins dating back to the 1960's. It was designed as a communication protocol to talk between _DTE_ (data terminal equipment) and _DCE_ (data communication equipment). It is closely related to the [UART communication protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/uart-communication-protocol/) provided by most microcontrollers, except that RS-232 uses higher-voltage signalling whilst UART is restricted between `VCC` of the microcontroller and `GND`.

|                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------
| Drive Type                | Single-ended
| Num. Wires (excl. GND)    | 2 (TX/RX) or 4 (TX/RX and RTS/CTS)
| Duplexity                 | Full
| Connection Topology       | Point-to-point
| OSI Layers                | Layers 1 (physical) and 2 (data link)

RS-232 is commonly used today for a variety of different purposes in embedded systems, incl industrial equipment, test and measurement equipment. RS-232 ports are no longer available on most desktop computers (and certainly not on laptops), but USB-to-RS232 adapters are cheap, popular and easy to use with almost any operating system. Microcontroller UART peripherals are commonly connected to a UART-to-RS232 converter to send data that is going off-board.

## Pinout

## Revisions

* RS-232C (or just shortened to RS-232)
* EIA-232-D (1987)
* EIA/TIA-232-E (1991)

## Flow Control

The flow control is a way of detecting when the receiver or transmitter is ready to accept or send new data. The UART protocol provides a few (all optional) methods for flow control:

* Hardware RTS/CTS lines
* Software XON/XOFF flow control

### RTS/CTS

This is done by various additional connections to the standard transmit, receive and ground wires. The two most common are CTS and RTS. Typically, a micro-controller may have one or two UART peripherals that support this feature, while the rest are just basic non-flow control UART's.

A small amount of power can be extracted from the RTS and CTS lines for powering low-power devices.

The following tables lists all of the flow control signals (as well as the data signals), with respect to the device in question. Matching signals are grouped together.

| Signal | Port Type | Description | DB-25 Pin | DE-9 Pin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DTR (Data Terminal Ready) | Output | DTE drives this to indicate to the DCE that it is present. | 5 | 4 |
| DCD (Data Carrier Detect) | Input | DCE drives this when it is connected to the telephone line. | 8 | 1 |
| RI (Ring Indicator) | Input | The DCE drives this when it has detected a phone call. Note that there is no matching signal going the other way. | 22 | 9 |
| RTS (Request To Send) | Output | DTE drives this to tell the DCE to get ready to receive data. | 4 | 7 |
| CTS (Clear To Send) | Input | Driven by the DCE when it is ready to accept data. | 5 | 8 |
| TxD (Data Transmit) | Output | The DTE sends data to the DCE over this line. | 2 | 3 |
| RxD (Data Receive) | Input | The DCE sends data to the DTE over this line. | 3 | 2 |
| Common Ground (GND) | n/a | The common ground for all signals. | 7 | 5 |
| Protective Ground (PG) | n/a | The protective ground. This is usually just connected up to the common ground on the PCB. | 1 | n/a |

<Aside type="caution">
There is confusion of how to connect two RS-232 (or UART!) devices together arises when it is not terminal equipment (DTE) connected to modem equipment (DCE). In the embedded world, microcontrollers and other devices which support RS-232/UART can act either as a DTE or a DCE. **Take particular care when connecting RS-232/UART ports together on embedded devices!**
</Aside>

> Rule-of-thumb: Most RS-232 serial interfaces with a male 9 or 25 pin connector are DTE's, most with a female 9 or 25 pin connector are DCE's.

Most often, manufacturers label the UART pins as DTE's. In this case, you have to swap all connections with their matching line. So TxD of device 1 is connected to RxD of device 2, RxD of device 1 is connected to TxD of device 2, RTS of device 1 is connected to CTS of device 2, e.tc.

## Transmission Distances

15m or less

## Higher-Level Protocols

Do you need a higher-level communication protocol that works over a UART connection? See the [SerialFiller](https://github.com/gbmhunter/SerialFiller) library on GitHub (written in C++). SerialFiller uses a publish/subscribe mechanism and works well on point-to-point serial connections such as UART.

## Interfaces

The pinout of a typical Analog Devices RS-232 to UART transceiver is shown below.

Another example of a RS-232 to CMOS UART converter is the MAX3221IDBE4. It supports an auto-shutdown feature based on the voltage-level of the receiving RS-232 line.

## Driver ICs

### MAX3227

The Maxim MAX3227 is a popular RS-232 line transceiver. It contains 1 driver and 1 receiver as is designed to be driven from CMOS signals (e.g. connected to a microcontroller UART)[^bib-maxim-max32xx-ds]. Texas Instruments produces a drop-in replacement part for the MAX3227, the MAX3227CDBR (the CDBR standing for commercial temp. range, tape and reeled)[^bib-ti-max3227cdbr-ds].

## Cheap Discrete-Part RS-232 To TTL Converter

A RS-232 to TTL logic-level converter can be made out of a few discrete components. The schematic shown below uses some clever circuitry, including a charge-pump like circuit, to generate the negative voltage required for RS-232 transmission back to the computer.

## RS-232 DE-9 To RJ-45 Cables

Many routers contain a RJ-45 socket that carry a RS-232 bus. They are designed so you can plug in a DE-9 to RJ-45 cable and connect the router to a PC for configuration. One example of a cable is the [Tripp Lite RJ45 to DB9F Cisco Serial Console Port Rollover Cable](https://assets.tripplite.com/product-pdfs/en/p430006.pdf), as shown in the below image:

The common pinout for this cable is shown in the table below[^bib-juniper-rj45-to-db9-adapter] [^bib-us-converters-making-db-to-rj45-adapter]:
