title: Communication Protocols
type: page
---

This page features common communication protocols that are used both in embedded and software design. This includes protocols used between cores (hardware modules) inside an FPGA, between microcontrollers and other ICs on a circuit board, between two circuit boards in the same product, and between two products separated by a large distance.

Check out the child pages for more information on each protocol.
