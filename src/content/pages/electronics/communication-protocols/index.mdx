This page features common communication protocols that are used both in embedded and software design. This includes protocols used between cores (hardware modules) inside an FPGA, between microcontrollers and other ICs on a circuit board, between two circuit boards in the same product, and between two products separated by a large distance.

If you are interested in protocols used between ICs on a circuit board, look at:

* [UART](/electronics/communication-protocols/uart-communication-protocol/)
* [I2C](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/)
* [I3C](/electronics/communication-protocols/i3c-communication-protocol/)
* [SPI](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/)
* [1-Wire](/electronics/communication-protocols/1-wire-protocol/)
* [LVDS](/electronics/communication-protocols/lvds-low-voltage-differential-signalling/)
* [I2S](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2s-communication-protocol/)
* [4-20mA Current Loops](/electronics/communication-protocols/4-20ma-current-loops/)
* [EasyScale](/electronics/communication-protocols/easyscale-protocol/)
* [AT Commands](/electronics/communication-protocols/at-commands/)

If you are interested in protocols used between two electronic devices in close proximity, look at:

* [RS-232](/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-232-protocol/)
* [RS-422](/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-422-protocol/)
* [RS-485](/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-485-protocol/)
* [CAN bus](/electronics/communication-protocols/can-protocol/)
* [LIN](/electronics/communication-protocols/lin-protocol/)
* [PROFIBUS](/electronics/communication-protocols/profibus-protocol/)
* [Modbus](/electronics/communication-protocols/modbus-protocol/)
* [USB](/electronics/communication-protocols/usb-protocol/)
* [PCIe](/electronics/communication-protocols/pci-express-pcie/)

If you are interested in wireless communication, look at:

* [Bluetooth](/electronics/communication-protocols/bluetooth/)
* [Cellular](/electronics/communication-protocols/cellular/)

If you are interested in protocols that use the TCP/IP suite, look at:

* [Ethernet](/electronics/communication-protocols/ethernet-protocol/)
* [MQTT](/electronics/communication-protocols/mqtt-protocol/)
* [TFTP](/electronics/communication-protocols/trivial-file-transfer-protocol-tftp/)
* [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](/electronics/communication-protocols/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/)
* [IEEE 2030.5 Smart Grid](/electronics/communication-protocols/ieee-2030-5-smart-grid/)
