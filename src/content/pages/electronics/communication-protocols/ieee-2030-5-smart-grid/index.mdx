IEEE 2030.5 is a REST based communication protocol (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints) for electrical smart grids to use for communication.As such, it leverages HTTP/HTTPS and TCP for communication[^ieee-2030-5-2018-smart-energy-profile-application].

The standard allows people to extend 2030.5 with proprietary extensions. One condition is that they do not use the `smartenergy` Service Type[^ieee-2030-5-2018-smart-energy-profile-application].

## Smart Inverters and Rule 21

The state of California introduced Rule 21 which mandates the use of a standardized communication protocol for smart inverters (which count as _Distributed Energy Resources_, or DERs) to manage energy distribution.

The main changes to the S1 version of IEEE 2030.5 was to add additional support for DERs, which in turn was driven from CA Rule 21 phases 1, 2 and 3[^kitu-systems-ieee-2030-5-security-overview].

## Server Implementations

[quantumscript/IEEE_2030_5_gridappsd_server](https://github.com/quantumscript/IEEE_2030_5_gridappsd_server) is a Python-based server that implements the Common Smart Inverter Profile (CSIP)[^github-quantumscript-ieee-2030-5-gridappsd-server].
