<WarningIsNotes />

## History

Originally, ethernet used a single coax cable (10base2).

## Components

### Connector

RJ45 jack. Connectors which integrate the magnetics are called _integrated connector modules_ (ICMs).

### Magnetics

Magnetics are part of the Ethernet specification for all xBASE-T networks (which includes pretty much every Ethernet PHY standard except for the first StarLAN-1, StarLAN-10 and LattisNet).

There are two options for magnetics, either:

. Buy a ethernet magnetics component for your PCB.
. Buy a jack (connector) which already has the magnetics integrated into it. Connectors which integrate the magnetics are called _integrated connector modules_ (ICMs).

### Physical Layer (PHY)

The _PHY_ is the circuitry which drives the magnetics.

### MAC

## Standards

Many of the IEEE standards are in a form similar to `10BASE-T`. In this example, the `10` represents a throughput of 10 Mbps, `BASE` is because it uses baseband transmission (the twisted pairs can transmit frequencies all the way down to DC), and the `T` indicates the transmission medium used.[^wikipedia-baseband]

### 10BASE-T

Used Cat 3 cable.

### 10BASE-T1L

Designed for automotive and IoT applications.

### 10BASE-T1S

Designed for automotive and IoT applications. Allows for a multi-drop architecture.

## Ethernet Jacks

Some ethernet jacks come with the magnetics already in-built, saving you the trouble of including them yourself on the mounted-to PCB

## Power Over Ethernet (PoE)

_Power over Ethernet_ (PoE) is the term used to describe ethernet cables/systems that also provide a power source over the same cable as the data. Typically 44-57VDC (48V is a common choice) is passed over one or more of the twisted pairs in most ethernet cables. Data and power can be transmitted along the same twisted pairs as long as proper transformer-based extraction (center-tapped isolation transformers) of the AC data signal and DC power is used. The early PoE standards could provide around 10W of power, but the newer standards allow up to approx. 75W.

_Power sourcing equipment_ (PSE) are the devices that provide power onto the ethernet bus. The _powered device_ (PD) is the device on the other end of the cable which is consuming the power. The PDs can be up to 100m away from the PSE (as defined by the existing Ethernet standard, this is unchanged with the introduction PoE).

A _PoE injector_ is a stand-alone device used to add ("inject") DC power into an existing Ethernet cable.

The _assured power_ is the amount of power available to the powered device at the end of cable. This is less than the power outputted by the PSE due to the energy lost in the impedance of the cabling.

## Single Pair Ethernet (SPE)

Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) is a version of Ethernet which uses a single twisted pair. Coupled with PoDL (Power over Data Lines), it is impressive that a single twisted pair can be both used to send bi-directional data (~10Mbps) and power (~50W) over the same cable!

Bi-directional data over the same pair works by each side cancelling out their own sent signal.

### Power over Data Lines (PoDL)

Power over Data Lines (PoDL) is the name given to the trick of powering devices over single pair ethernet by injecting a DC voltage and superimposing it with the signal onto the single twisted pair cable. The IEEE 802.3bu-2016 amendment first introduced PoDL for SPE standards 100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1. It is now defined for all SPE standards including 100BASE-T1, 1000BASE-T1, 2.5GBASE-T1, 5GBASE-T1 and 10GBASE-T1.[^wikipedia-power-over-ethernet]

<Aside type="note">
PoDL is not only defined for single pair Ethernet, but also for multi-pair. In a multi-pair setup, the power is applied between single conductors in different pairs.[^wikipedia-power-over-ethernet]
</Aside>

The standard names a device which provides power as Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) and a device which consumes power as the Powered Device (PD).[^wurth-rd041-design-of-spoe-system]

<IRef iref="fig-spe-with-podl-diagram"/> is a schematic showing the core component used to build a SPE with PoDL system.

Design based of example from Wurth Elektronik.[^wurth-rd041-design-of-spoe-system]</Image>

When PSE wants to provide power to a PD device, it first attempts to detect a PD device, and then classify it using a process called SCCP.[^electric-ui-deep-dive-single-pair-ethernet] The protocol also uses Cable Resistance Measurement (CRM) to assess the quality of the connection.[^wurth-rd041-design-of-spoe-system]

For convenience, the standard allows the DC voltage to applied in either direction by the power sourcing equipment. This means that the receiver requires a rectifier (or similar) to support reverse polarity.[^electric-ui-deep-dive-single-pair-ethernet]

## EtherCAT

EtherCAT is a communication protocol with it's physical layer following the Ethernet standard in IEEE 802.3 (the magnetics and PHY are the same). However, the similarity somewhat stops there, it uses a novel technique where:

- Each device is daisy chained to the next via Ethernet cable.
- The master emits a Ethernet frame (telegram).
- Each slave device reads the data addressed to it "on the fly", and inserts it's own data into the frame "on the fly".
- Propagation times between slaves are only limited by hardware propagation delays.

The master node can be implemented using any device with standard Ethernet capability, the same magnetics, PHY and MAC is used. However, whilst the slave node use the same magnetics and PHY, the MAC is replaced by a special EtherCAT Slave Controller (ESC) which can process frames on the fly.

## lwIP

lwIP is a BSD-licensed implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite with a focus on small resource (RAM and flash memory) usage. It is designed for embedded systems, and requires only 10's of kB of free RAM and 40kB's of ROM (e.gc. flash)[^lwip-homepage].

It has support for IP, IPv6, UDP, TCP, ARP, PPPoE and more[^lwip-homepage].

## Popular Chips

### WIZnet W5xxx Family

The WIZnet W5xxx family of serial-to-ethernet ICs is very popular in the maker community. This family of ICs is used by the Arduino Ethernet board are Arduino Ethernet Shield.

* W5200: This chip implements the PHY, the TCP/IP stack (fully hardwired), and the 10/100 MAC Ethernet MAC, in a QFN-48 package. It uses the [SPI Protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/) to talk to a microcontroller. It's power save features include power-down mode and WOL (wake on LAN). It runs of 3.3V but has 5V I/O tolerance.
* [W5500](https://www.wiznet.io/product-item/w5500/): Supports up to 8 independent sockets (i.e. 8 different connections to different ports). Contains a 10BaseT/100BaseTX PHY. Like the W5200 is runs of 3.3V but has 5V I/O tolerance.

### Microchip LAN867x Family

Microchip's LAN8670, LAN8671 and LAN8672 are ethernet PHY ICs that use [^10BASE-T1S, 10BASE-T1S], allowing a multi-drop architecture of "at least 8 nodes and a minimum 25m of length".
