Ultra-wide band (UWB) is a communication protocol based of the IEEE 802.15.4a and IEEE 802.15.4z standards.[^qorvo-ultra-wideband] It allows precise time-of-flight measurement of radio signals which can provide 10 cm accuracy distance and location measurements between nodes. It is more accurate than GPS and can work indoors, but requires references ("anchor") nodes to be useful. It's name stems from the fact it uses a wide bandwidth (>500 MHz) when communicating. This allows for transmitting a large amount of signal energy without interfering with existing conventional protocols which are narrowband (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.). UWB does not modulate the amplitude, phase and frequency of a carrier signal like a typical RF protocol. Instead, it uses simple time modulation or pulse-position modulation (PPM).[^wikipedia-ultra-wideband]

## DecaWave DW1000A IC

The DecaWave DW1000A IC (now owned by Qorvo) was the first single chip UWB transceiver.[^symmetry-electronics-overview-of-decawave-dw1000a-ic] It was announced in 2013.[^wikipedia-ultra-wideband]
