<WarningIsNotes />

Multi-Drop Bus (MDB) is a communication protocol used with the vending machine industry. The bus is used for communication between the various subsystems inside a vending machine, including the main controller, currency detector, and other peripherals[^wikipedia-multi-drop-bus].

Payment devices such as the [Nayax Onyx](/electronics/components/contactless-payment-devices/) can use MDB to communicate with other parts of a vending machine.
