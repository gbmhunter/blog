<WarningIsNotes />

Inter-Integrated Circuit Sound (I2S) is a synchronous, serial communication protocol used to transmit audio data between integrated circuits. It is commonly used to send audio between electronics such as MCUs, DSPs and audio amplifiers.

It can be written/pronounced as:

1. I2S, pronounced "eye-two-ess".
1. I²S, pronounced "eye-squared-ess".
1. IIS, pronounced "eye-eye-ess".

<Aside type="tip">
Although it sounds similar, I2S is not to be confused with general-purpose [I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/).

## I2S Signals

There are three signals in the I2S protocol:

1. **Serial Clock (SCK)**: This is the clock signal that is used to synchronise the data transfer between the master and slave devices. The clock signal is generated by the master device and is used by the slave device to sample the data.
1. **Word Select (WS)**: This signal is used to indicate whether the data being transferred is left-channel, right-channel or a control word. The WS signal is generated by the master device. It is also known as left-right clock (LRCLK) or frame sync (FS)[^wikipedia-i2s].
1. **Serial Data (DATA)**: This is the actual audio data that is being transferred between the master and slave devices.

### Serial Clock (SCK)

The Serial Clock (SCK) signal is used to synchronise the data transfer between the master and slave devices. The clock signal is generated by the master device and is used by the slave device to sample the data.

### Word Select (WS)

The Word Select (WS) signal lets the receiver know whether the data being transmitted is for channel 1 (WS = 0) or channel 2 (WS = 1). For stereo signals WS = 0 is used for the left channel and WS = 1 is used for the right channel.

WS is normally synchronized with the falling edge of SCK, and is latched by the receiver on the rising edge.

WS has a 50% duty cycle and has the same frequency as the audio sample rate. WS changes one cycle before the MSB of the next piece of data is transmitted.

### Serial Data (SD)

Data is sent signed in two's complement format. The Most Significant Byte (MSB) is sent first. No fixed number of bits per frame are specified in the standard, and I2S allows this to be set by the user. The WS signal is used to indicate the end of a frame.

## Frameworks and Libraries

[Zephyr RTOS](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/) has an [I2S API](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/hardware/peripherals/audio/i2s.html) that can be used to configure and use I2S peripherals on supported MCUs. It also supports non-standard extensions such as PCM short/long frame sync and left/right justified data formats[^zephyr-i2s-bus-docs].
