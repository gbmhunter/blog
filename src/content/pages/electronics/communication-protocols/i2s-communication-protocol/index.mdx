<WarningIsNotes />

_Inter-Integrated Circuit (Inter-IC) Sound (I2S)_ is a synchronous, serial communication protocol which uses Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) to transmit audio data between integrated circuits, typically those within the same PCB. It is commonly used to send audio between electronics such as MCUs, DSPs and audio amplifiers.

It can be written/pronounced as:

1. I2S, pronounced "eye-two-ess".
1. I²S, pronounced "eye-squared-ess".
1. IIS, pronounced "eye-eye-ess".

<Aside type="tip">
Although it sounds similar, I2S is not to be confused with general-purpose [I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/). They are related in that they were both created by Philips (now NXP) and designed for communication between ICs. That's about where the similarities end!
</Aside>

ICs connected using I2S for audio data transfer will typically also be connected via [I2C](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/) for control and configuration.

## History

I2S was originally developed by Phillips in the 1980s. The first I2S specification was published in 1986, and it was revised in 1996[^all-about-circuits-intro-to-i2s] [^elprocus-i2s-protocol].

## I2S Signals

There are three signals in the I2S protocol:

1. **Serial Clock (SCK)**: This is the clock signal that is used to synchronise the data transfer between the master and slave devices. The clock signal is generated by the master device and is used by the slave device to sample the data.
1. **Word Select (WS)**: This signal is used to indicate whether the data being transferred is left-channel, right-channel or a control word. The WS signal is generated by the master device. It is also known as left-right clock (LRCLK)[^nordic-nrf52-i2s-interface] or frame sync (FS)[^wikipedia-i2s].
1. **Serial Data (DATA)**: This is the actual audio data that is being transferred between the master and slave devices.

The below diagram shows the digital waveforms of the three I2S signals:

The three signals are explained in more detail below.

### Serial Clock (SCK)

The Serial Clock (SCK) signal is used to synchronise the data transfer between the master and slave devices. The clock signal is generated by the master device and is used by the slave device to sample the data.

The SCK frequency is dependent on:

1. The number of bits per sample (typically 8, 12, 16 or 24 bits).
1. The number of channels (e.g. 2 for left and right audio).
1. The audio sample rate (samples per second, commonly $44.1kHz$).

For example, for a 16-bit stereo audio signal with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, the SCK frequency would be:

$$
\begin{align}
f_{SCK} &= 16 \text{bits/sample} \times 2 \text{channels} \times 44.1 kHz\\
        &= 1.41 MHz
\end{align}
$$

So even though you typically think of audio as being in the 0-20 kHz range, the digital bitstream that represents the audio can quickly climb into the MHz range. 1-10 MHz is generally not a problem for short traces on a PCB without high-speed design considerations.

SCK runs continuously[^all-about-circuits-intro-to-i2s].

### Word Select (WS)

The Word Select (WS) signal lets the receiver know whether the data being transmitted is for channel 1 (WS = 0) or channel 2 (WS = 1). For stereo signals WS = 0 is used for the left channel and WS = 1 is used for the right channel.

It is also known as left-right clock (LRCLK, LRCK[^nordic-nrf52-i2s-interface]) or frame sync (FS).

WS is normally synchronized with the falling edge of SCK, and is latched by the receiver on the rising edge.

WS has a 50% duty cycle and has the same frequency as the audio sample rate. WS changes one cycle before the MSB of the next piece of data is transmitted.

### Serial Data (SD)

Data is sent signed in two's complement format. The Most Significant Byte (MSB) is sent first. No fixed number of bits per frame are specified in the standard, and I2S allows this to be set by the user. The WS signal is used to indicate the end of a frame.

Data is sampled at the receiver on the rising edge of SCK[^all-about-circuits-intro-to-i2s].

## MCU Support

The Nordic nRF52 and [nRF53](/programming/microcontrollers/nordic/nrf53/) MCU families have I2S peripherals. These peripherals allow for both the transmission and reception of audio data. They usually support DMA for transferring audio data in and out of memory without CPU intervention[^nordic-nrf52-i2s-interface].

## Frameworks and Libraries

[Zephyr RTOS](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/) has an [I2S API](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/hardware/peripherals/audio/i2s.html) that can be used to configure and use I2S peripherals on supported MCUs. It also supports non-standard extensions such as PCM short/long frame sync and left/right justified data formats[^zephyr-i2s-bus-docs].
