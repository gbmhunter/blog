<WarningIsNotes />

I2S is a synchronous, serial communication protocol used to transmit audio data between integrated circuits. It is commonly used to send audio between electronics such as MCUs, DSPs and audio amplifiers.

<Aside type="tip">
Although it sounds similar, I2S is not to be confused with [I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/).

## I2S Signals

There are three signals in the I2S protocol:

1. **Serial Clock (SCK)**: This is the clock signal that is used to synchronise the data transfer between the master and slave devices. The clock signal is generated by the master device and is used by the slave device to sample the data.
1. **Word Select (WS)**: This signal is used to indicate whether the data being transferred is left-channel, right-channel or a control word. The WS signal is generated by the master device.
1. **Serial Data (DATA)**: This is the actual audio data that is being transferred between the master and slave devices.
