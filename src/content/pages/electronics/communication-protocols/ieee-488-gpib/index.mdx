IEEE-488 is a parallel 8-bit short-range multi-master communications bus. It is more commonly known as **GPIB** (_General Purpose Interface Bus_).

## History

In the late 1960's, Hewlett-Packard developed the _HP Interface Bus (HP-IB)_ to connect the automated test and measurement instruments they manufactured to computers and other controllers. HP licensed the HP-IB technology to other manufacturers, and as the bus became popular, it became known as the _General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB)_[^wikipedia-ieee-488].

In 1975 IEEE standardized the GPIB as _Standard Digital Interface For Programmable Instrumentation (IEEE 488)_. In 1987 IEEE released _488.2_ as _Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands_ which specified basic device-independent syntax and messages. 

Although initially designed for connecting instrumentation to computers, in 1977 HP also used the GPIB bus inside it's Commodore PET range of personal computers to connect peripherals[^wikipedia-ieee-488]. However this was quickly replaced with faster buses such as SCSI.

In instrumentation, GPIB has generally been replaced with more recent communication protocols such as USB and Ethernet for new instrumentation.
