<WarningIsNotes />

Kirchhoff's circuit laws are two laws that describe how currents and voltages sum up in electrical circuits. Along with Ohm's law, they are probably the most often used laws in circuit design. They are relatively easy to understand and quickly become second nature.

Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) describes how the currents entering and leaving a node sum up to zero. Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) describes how the voltages around a closed loop sum up to zero. More on these below!

## Kirchhoff's Current Law

Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the sum of currents entering an electrical node must equal the sum of currents leaving that node. <IRef iref="fig-kirchhoffs-current-law-i1-i2-i3" /> shows the basic idea. The dot represents an electrical node, which is essentially a connection point between two or more conductive parts of the circuit.

<Aside type="tip">
Fun fact: The use of the symbol $i$ for current comes from the French word "intensit√© du courant". Ampere was French. Although it could be the "intensity" of anything, I guess it's good enough since we already use $c$ for Coulomb.

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law

Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) states that the sum of voltages around a closed loop must equal zero.
