This page is about capacitive sensing methods.

For information about capacitors in general, see the [Capacitor page](/electronics/components/capacitors).

Capacitive sensing is a widely used technique for proximity detection, touch-screens, level measurement, and distance measurements. It is used in the more expensive touch-screens found in today's smart phones (as opposed to the cheaper and poorer performing resistive touch screens), for contact-less buttons (see page on [Capacitive Touch Sensing](/electronics/circuit-design/capacitive-touch-sensing)), the distance measuring mechanism in digital callipers, liquid level measurement and much more.

## Capacitance Sensors

## Linear

Linear capacitive sensors measure a linear position change (i.e. not rotational).

The following image shows the typical dimensions of the linear encoder typically used in digital calliper design.

## Rotational

Rotational capacitive sensors can be used in similar situations to those that use optical encoders.

Examples of a small capacitive encoder:
