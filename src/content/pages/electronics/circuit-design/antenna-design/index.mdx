Antennas are an import part of any circuit design which incorporates RF frequencies.

## Terminology

| Term        | Description      |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| VSWR        | VSWR is an initialism for "**Voltage Standing Wave Ratio**". The bandwidth of an antenna is usually defined as the range of frequencies at which VSWR is less than 2. |

## Dipoles

The voltage in a dipole is maximum at the ends, and 0 at the middle. The current is the opposite, with the maximum being in the middle, and being 0 at both ends.

## PCB Antennas

You have to consider the placement of other components surrounding the PCB antenna. The following diagram shows the minimum recommended clearances between a PCB antenna and other components.

## Shorting Antennas

Note that shorting out an antenna is not an effective way of stopping it from communicating. At RF frequencies, a direct short with a piece of wire is no longer a direct short, and can for example, appear inductive. This means the antenna can still work, and sometime make it perform better! I have shorted out cellular modem antennas before with pliers and the signal strength increased!
