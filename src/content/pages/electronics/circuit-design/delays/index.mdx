_Delay circuits_ are used to delay the progression of a analogue or digital signal through a circuit.

## RC with Schmitt Trigger

A [RC circuit](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/#first-order-low-pass-rc-filter) combined with a Schmitt trigger can be used to create a digital delay. The RC circuit converts a sharp input transition into a slower transition based on the RC circuit time constant. The Schmitt trigger then "sharpens" up the edges again by switching it's output quickly when the input reaches certain thresholds.

The 74HC14 "Hex Inverter with Schmitt Trigger Inputs" family of ICs are commonly used as the Schmitt trigger.

By adding another RC circuit between the two Schmitt triggers, the delay time can be made to be the same for the high-to-low as the low-to-high transition. You will want to split your delay time evenly between the two RC circuits.

## 555 Timer

A [555 timer](/electronics/components/timers-and-multivibrators/) can be configured to create a variable digital delay.
