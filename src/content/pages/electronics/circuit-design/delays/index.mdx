<WarningIsNotes />

_Delay circuits_ are used to delay the progression of a analogue or digital signal through a circuit. You may want to delay a signal to:

* Allow time for a circuit to settle.
* Debounce a switch.
* Create an audio delay/reverb effect.
* Create an oscillator at a specific frequency (feeding back the output of three inverters connected in series creates an oscillator).

## RC with Schmitt Trigger

A [RC circuit](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/#first-order-low-pass-rc-filter) combined with  Schmitt triggers can be used to create a digital delay. The RC circuit converts a sharp input transition into a slower transition based on the RC circuit time constant. The Schmitt trigger then "sharpens" up the edges again by switching it's output quickly when the input reaches certain thresholds. <IRef iref="fig-schmitt-trigger-delay-single-rc" /> shows the circuit. This uses two inverting Schmitt triggers -- the purpose of the second one (U2) is to re-invert the signal so it is the same polarity as the input.

<Image iref="fig-schmitt-trigger-delay-single-rc" src={import('./_assets/schmitt-trigger-delay-single-rc.webp')} width="600px">A delay circuit made from a RC circuit and a Schmitt trigger.</Image>

<IRef iref="fig-schmitt-trigger-single-rc-waveforms" /> shows the waveforms for the single RC delay circuit. Notice how the delays are not symmetrical. The delay for the low-to-high transition is longer than the high-to-low transition. This can be fixed by adding another RC circuit between the two Schmitt triggers (more on this below).

One downside to this circuit is that there is a "cooldown" period between transitions. This is the time it takes to the RC circuit to settle so that it can work correctly for the next transition. As such, the cooldown is normally about $5\tau$ (5 time constants) where $\tau = RC$. If transitions occur within this cooldown period, the circuit will not work as expected, sometimes transitioning to quickly (the RC circuit has not settled yet, and already has a head-start in going back in the other direction), or not transitioning at all (e.g. a transition to high and then back to low before the output has switched would result in no output change).

### Design Procedure

You generally want to pick a capacitance in the range of $100\,pF$ to $1\,\mu F$. This is because if the capacitance is lower than $100\,pF$, parasitic capacitance (typically in the $1-20pF$ range) will be have a significant effect on the delay. Capacitances higher than $1\,\mu F$ start to get more expensive, are physically larger, and start to use dielectrics (e.g. `X7R` or `X5R`) which cause the capacitance to significantly vary with voltage.

The 74HC14 "Hex Inverter with Schmitt Trigger Inputs" family of ICs are commonly used as the Schmitt trigger. You would then pick a resistance to give the desired delay. To do this, we need to use the RC charging equation (see the [RC Charging Circuits](/electronics/circuit-design/rc-charging-circuits/) page for more info).

$$
\begin{align}
V = V_{CC} (1 - e^{ \large{\left[ \frac{-t}{RC} \right]} })
\end{align}
$$

In this situation, $V$ would be the threshold voltage ($V_{T+}$ or $V_{T-}$ depending on the transition direction), $V_{CC}$ is the supply voltage, $t$ is the desired delay time, and $C$ is the capacitance.

We need to rearrange this equation to solve for $R$:

$$
\begin{align}
V &= V_{CC} (1 - e^{ \large{\left[ \frac{-t}{RC} \right]} }) \nonumber \\
\frac{V}{V_{CC}} &= 1 - e^{ \large{\left[ \frac{-t}{RC} \right]} } \nonumber \\
e^{ \large{\left[ \frac{-t}{RC} \right]} } &= 1 - \frac{V}{V_{CC}} \nonumber \\
\frac{-t}{RC} &= \ln(1 - \frac{V}{V_{CC}}) \nonumber \\
RC &= \frac{-t}{\ln(1 - \frac{V}{V_{CC}})} \nonumber \\
R &= \frac{-t}{\ln(1 - \frac{V}{V_{CC}})C} \htmlId{eqn-schmitt-trigger-delay-resistance}{} \\
\end{align}
$$

We'll use the Texas Instruments SN74HC14 "SNx4HC14 Hex Inverters with Schmitt-Trigger Inputs" IC. <IRef iref="tbl-schmitt-trigger-thresholds" /> shows the trigger thresholds for the SN74HC14 taken from the datasheet[^ti-snx4hc14-ds].

Unfortunately, $+3.3\,V$ is not one of the supply voltages the thresholds are given for. We'll do a bit of simple linear interpolation to estimate the thresholds. We'll use typical values to keep things simple -- however bear in mind that the delay time could vary somewhat due to the tolerances of the thresholds!

$$
\begin{align}
V_{T+(3.3V)} &= 1.2\,V + \left(3.3\,V - 2\,V\right) \times \frac{2.5\,V - 1.2\,V}{4.5\,V - 2\,V} \nonumber \\
&= 1.2\,V + 1.3 \times \frac{1.3\,V}{2.5\,V} \nonumber \\
&= 1.2\,V + 0.676\,V \nonumber \\
&= 1.88\,V
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
V_{T-(3.3V)} &= 0.6\,V + \left(3.3\,V - 2\,V\right) \times \frac{1.6\,V - 0.6\,V}{4.5\,V - 2\,V} \nonumber \\
&= 0.6\,V + 1.3 \times \frac{1\,V}{2.5\,V} \nonumber \\
&= 0.6\,V + 0.52\,V \nonumber \\
&= 1.12\,V
\end{align}
$$

We'll now pick a capacitance. Let's try $C = 1\,\text{nF}$. We can now calculate the resistance so that the RC circuit charges up to $1.88\,V$ in $100\,\mu s$. Using <IRef iref="eqn-schmitt-trigger-delay-resistance" /> we have:

$$
\begin{align}
R &= \frac{-t}{\ln(1 - \frac{V}{V_{CC}})C} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{-100\,\mu s}{\ln(1 - \frac{1.88\,V}{3.3\,V}) \times 1\,\text{nF}} \nonumber \\
&= 119\,k\Omega
\end{align}
$$

Solved! <IRef iref="fig-schmitt-trigger-delay-single-rc-example" /> shows the completed circuit. SN74HC14 contains 6 individual Schmitt triggers, so we use 2 of them from the same IC, hence `U1A` and `U1B`.

### Symmetrical Delays

The circuit shown in <IRef iref="fig-schmitt-trigger-delay-single-rc" /> does not have symmetrical delays. The delay for the low-to-high transition is longer than the high-to-low transition. This will occur whenever the $V_{T+}$ and $V_{T-}$ thresholds for the Schmitt trigger are not symmetrical around the midpoint of the supply voltage. This perfect condition is unlikely to occur in practise. <IRef iref="tbl-schmitt-trigger-symmetry" /> summarises the typical thresholds for the SN74HC14 and calculates the center point of these thresholds. As you can see, they are not equal to 0.5 (but pretty close, being in the range of 0.44 to 0.46).

By adding another RC circuit between the two Schmitt triggers as shown in <IRef iref="fig-schmitt-trigger-delay-symmetrical" />, the delay time for the positive and negative going transitions can be made to be the same (well...more equal, there is still a rather large manufacturing tolerance for $V_{T+}$ and $V_{T-}$).

<Image iref="fig-schmitt-trigger-delay-symmetrical" src={import('./_assets/schmitt-trigger-delay-symmetrical.webp')} width="800px">A RC/Schmitt trigger delay circuit with symmetrical positive and negative going delays.</Image>

When doing this you will want to split your delay time evenly between the two RC circuits (i.e. identical RC circuits). You can use the same process as in the example above with a single RC element, but set $t$ to half the desired delay time.

<Aside type="example" title="Example: Symmetrical RC/Schmitt Trigger Delay">

Use the same requirements as in the previous example (100us delay), but make the delay time equal for both positive and negative going transitions.

$t$ for each RC circuit is now $50\,\mu s$ (half the total delay time).

$$
\begin{align}
R &= \frac{-t}{\ln(1 - \frac{V}{V_{CC}})C} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{-50\,\mu s}{\ln(1 - \frac{1.88\,V}{3.3\,V}) \times 1\,\text{nF}} \nonumber \\
&= 59.3\,k\Omega
\end{align}
$$

## 555 Timer

A [555 timer](/electronics/components/timers-and-multivibrators/) can be configured to create a variable digital delay.

## Long Piece of Wire

It sounds almost too simple, but a suitably sized length of wire (or fibre-optic cable) can be used to create short delays. The propagation of an electrical signal is fast (around 0.6c), but not instant! Light travels about 30cm in one nanosecond, so you can get delays in the 0.1 to 100ns+ range with cable.

<Image iref="fig-propagation-of-electrical-signal-down-wire" src={import('./_assets/propagation-of-electrical-signal-down-wire.webp')} width="600px">The propagation of an electrical signal down a wire.</Image>

A great thing about this technique is that it works for both digital and analogue and is bi-directional.

This is a common technique in oscilloscopes.

## Delay Lines

[Delay lines](/electronics/components/delay-lines/) are digital ICs which can delay a digital signal by a certain amount of time. Many of these delay line ICs work internally by using a long chain of inverter gates, along with advanced circuitry to compensate for voltage and temperature variations and keep the delays accurate. Most also provide "taps" which are pins that connect to various points along the inverter gates. Dallas Semiconductor pioneered this technology with the production of the DS1000, DS1100, DS1135, DS1110, DS1077, DS1085 and DS1086 ICs[^analog-devices-how-delay-lines-work].

<IRef iref="fig-ds1135-internal-circuitry" /> shows the internal circuitry of the Analog Devices DS1135 "3-in-1 Delay Line" IC[^analog-devices-how-delay-lines-work].

<Image iref="fig-ds1135-internal-circuitry" src={import('./_assets/ds1135-internal-circuitry.webp')} width="500px">The internal circuitry of the Analog Devices DS1135 "3-in-1 Delay Line" IC[^analog-devices-how-delay-lines-work].</Image>

One example is the Analog Devices (formerly Dallas Semiconductor/Maxim) DS1110L "3V 10-Tap Silicon Delay Line" IC[^analog-devices-ds1110l-ds].

## Chains of Inverter Gates

A chain of inverter gates can be used to create a digital delay. You utilize the propagation delay (the time it takes for the input signal to appear at the output) of the inverter gates to create the delay. Most inverter gates have propagation delays from 1-20ns, so this approach is useful for short delays.

## Bucket Brigades

## Analogue Filters

Analogue filter

## Microcontroller

Of course, a microcontroller can be used to delay both digital and analogue signals. You would need basic GPIO to interface with digital signals, and a ADC and DAC for analogue signals. Combined with some memory (typically RAM) setup as a FIFO buffer, you can create a delay of your choosing. You will want to choose a sample rate that is at least 2 times higher than the highest frequency you want to delay (i.e. obey the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem). For analogue signals, the bit depth of the ADC and DAC will determine the resolution of the signal, and combined with the sample rate and desired delay time, will determine how much memory you will need.

<IRef iref="fig-mcu-delay" /> shows a pseudo-circuit (high-level diagram) illustrating how to create an analogue delay using a microcontroller.

<Image iref="fig-mcu-delay" src={import('./_assets/mcu-delay.webp')} width="600px">A pseudo-circuit illustrating how to create an analogue delay using a microcontroller.</Image>

Using a microcontroller could be the best approach if you:

- Already have microcontroller.
- Need to delay complex analogue signals.
- Need the delay to be highly configurable and/or updatable in the field (i.e. via a bootloader).
- The signal already passes through the microcontroller.

Using a microcontroller is probably not the best option if:

- All you need is a simple digital delay.
- It needs to be really quick (1-20ns range).
- You don't already have a microcontroller.
- The delay needs to be very reliable (e.g. not affected by firmware bugs or higher priority interrupts).
