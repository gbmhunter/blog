## Operating Modes

PWM hardware peripherals may not support every one these modes.

### Edge-Aligned (aka Asymmetric)

**Edge-aligned, the most common (and usually the default) operating mode for a PWM peripheral, is when one edge of the switching from on/off is aligned with the edge of of the PWM period.** In it's most basic form it is simple to implement, requiring a counter, and two registers, one for resetting the counter (which determines the PWM period), and another for comparing with the count value, and switching the output if it's greater than/less than/some logical expression (this sets the duty cycle).

### Centre-Aligned (aka Symmetric)

Centre-aligned PWM is good for motor control as it generates fewer harmonics in the output voltage and current than asymmetric PWM. Some centre-aligned PWM hardware peripherals implement this by using a counter which changes direction every cycle. It counts up for the first cycle, down for the second, and then repeats. Doing this **effectively reduces the PWM frequency by 2**. So to arrive back at the same PWM frequency as when in asymmetric mode, you have to half the period (in terms of clock cycles). This reduces your duty cycle resolution.

## Complementary Outputs

Some PWM peripherals have a complementary output feature. This is one PWM timer in hardware controls two output pins. One pin is the normal PWM signal, the other is the inverse of this. Complementary outputs are useful for driving H-bridges and other motor control circuits. Usually these peripherals will also support an adjustable programmable dead-time to prevent shoot-through.

One example is the STM32 advanced motor control timers which are present in many of the STM32 MCU families including the STM32G series.[^st-an4013-intro-to-timers-for-stm32-mcus]

## Dithering

Some PWM peripherals support dithering to artificially increase the resolution of the PWM. This is where you vary the duty cycle between two adjacent discreet duty cycle values to give the appearance of a higher resolution PWM. The output PWM is then the average of the two duty cycle values. You do not need to strictly alternate between the two values (which would only give you an equivalent of twice the resolution) -- instead you can spend more PWM cycles at one duty cycle than the other (e.g. 3 duty cycles at 50%, and then 1 duty cycle at 51% would give you can equivalent duty cycle of 50.25%).

Most PWM peripherals support this by providing a way to pass a sequence of duty cycles values in which the peripheral will automatically iterate through. They usually have the option of automatically repeating the sequence, or firing an interrupt so that CPU can load the next sequence.

A sequence of 2^n values will give you additional resolution of n bits. For example, a sequence of 16 dithered values with give you 4 bits of additional resolution.

<Aside type="example">
You have a PWM peripheral that runs of a 16 MHz clock. You are running the PWM at 100kHz. How many different duty cycle values are possible without any additional dithering, and then how many are possible with a dithering sequence of 16 values?

There are $16 MHz / 100 kHz = 160$ clock cycles per PWM period and so 160 different duty cycle values are possible without any additional dithering. With a dithering sequence of 16 values, you can get 160 * 16 = 2560 different duty cycle values.

## A Warning About PWM And Oscilloscopes

When viewing a PWM output on an oscilloscope, you can experience what is called _aliasing_, and oscilloscope seems to show that the PWM signal is stopping and then restarting at a rate much slower than the PWM frequency.

While your PWM could actually be doing this, more often than not what you are seeing is an **artefact caused by the digital sampling of the oscilloscope**. The following picture shows a 15kHz PWM signal appearing to stop and start every 10ms or so. I can assure you that the PWM signal is fine, it is the Rigol 100MHz oscilloscope showing the wrong thing.
