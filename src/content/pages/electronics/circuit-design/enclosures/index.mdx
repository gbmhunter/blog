## Extruded Aluminium Enclosures

Extruded aluminium enclosures consist of one piece of box-section aluminium for the body, with two plastic/metal end caps and a optional bezel. These enclosures are really good for small/medium PCB projects. The extruded aluminium normally has guide rails on the insides so that PCBs can slide into it. With the case being made of metal, heatsinking is easy.

<Aside type="note">
Connectors/indicators typically have to come out from either end. Right-angled PCB mount connectors are the easy to use with this configuration (panel mount can also be used).
