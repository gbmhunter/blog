## IEC 62368-1

IEC 62368-1 takes the approach of classifying electrical equipment as energy sources into 3 classes and prescribes safeguards against the energy sources. The safeguards are designed to reduce the chance of injury and property damage. The standard also classifies people into three different groups, the ordinary person, the instructed person and the skilled person.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Energy source</th>
    <th>Effect on people</th>
    <th>Effect on property</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Class 1</td>
      <td>Not painful (but may be detectable)</td>
      <td>Ignition not likely</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Class 2</td>
      <td>Painful, but no injury</td>
      <td>Ignition possible</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Class 3</td>
      <td>Injury can occur (including lethal and non-lethal injuries)</td>
      <td>Ignition likely and rapid spread of fire</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This standard places a large focus on 3 different classes of energy source, class 1, 2 and 3. A colour scheme of green (class 1), yellow (class 2) and red (class 3) is used throughout to indicate relevant requirements.

### Safeguards

Safeguards are further classified:

* Installation safeguard: Safeguard that is not controlled by the equipment manufacturer.
* Personal safeguard.
* Behavioural safeguards: These are further classified into:
  - Instructional safeguard:
  - Precautionary safeguard: The training and experience/supervision of an instructed person by a skilled person.
  - Skill safeguard: The education, training, knowledge and experience of a skilled person.
* Equipment safeguard.

* 2010
* 2014

The equivalent Australian/NZ standard is AS/NZS 62368.1.
