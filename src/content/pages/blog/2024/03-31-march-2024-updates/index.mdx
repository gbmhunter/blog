Released a new version of [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/), `v4.13.0` which adds smart copy/paste support with `Ctrl-Shift-C/V`.

Started using Umami Analytics for analytics alongside Google Analytics. Umami is self-hosted on a Amazon Lightsail instance. The subdomain `umami.mbedded.ninja` points to the IPv6 only instance. If Umami works well (it's privacy focused and is unlikely to be blocked by ad blockers), Google Analytics will be removed in the following months.

Added a new page on how to [setup Umami Analytics on Amazon Lightsail](/programming/website-design/running-umami-on-aws-lightsail/).
