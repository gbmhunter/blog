Completed the unfinished worked example on the [Finding The Intersection Of Two Arcs That Lie On A Sphere](/mathematics/geometry/spherical-geometry/finding-the-intersection-of-two-arcs-that-lie-on-a-sphere) page.

Fixed a bug with the custom `img` shortcode used on this site which was causing the wrong image to be displayed, or in some cases, no image at all.

Added a section on [CAN Bus Repeaters to the CAN Protocol page](/electronics/communication-protocols/can-protocol#can-bus-repeaters).

Added the new [How To Write Python Scripts For KiCAD page](/electronics/general/kicad/how-to-write-python-scripts-for-kicad).

Added information on [number-to-string functions in the C programming language to the String Manipulation page](/programming/languages/c/string-manipulation-in-c/).

Added a section on [floating-gate MOSFETS to the MOSFET page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets#floating-gate-mosfets).

Added a new [How To Change The IO Scheduling Class And Priority In Linux page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/how-to-change-io-scheduling-class-and-priority-in-linux).
