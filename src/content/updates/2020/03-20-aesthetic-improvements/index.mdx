## Removing Shurikens

I received feedback on a feeling I had had for sometime, the shurikens were adding clutter to each page on the blog and not adding much usefulness. These were hard to remove as I had spent a [good deal of time coding to get those to work](/updates/2019/03-10-adding-shurikens). All is not lost however, as it was a good exercise in learning how to build a "serverless" application on AWS's lambda service.
