* Information added on using low-pass RC filters for making a VDAC from a PWM source.

* Added information about the [10-bit I2C addressing scheme](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/).

* New [How To Calculate Track Current page](/pcb-design/how-to-calculate-maximum-track-current) under the PCB Design section of the website, with information, equations, and more info on how to calculate the maximum current a track (a.k.a. trace) on a PCB can take.

* Added new info on [NTC thermistor temperature sensing](/electronics/components/sensors/temperature-sensors/) with information on PTC and NTC thermistors, including how to connect them up to a microcontroller for temperature measurements.

* New [MicroBlaze page](/programming/microcontrollers/microblaze/) under Programming->Microcontrollers.

* New [Z-Wave page](/electronics/communication-protocols/z-wave) under Electronics->Communication Protocols.

* New information about the common-collector BJT amplifier.
