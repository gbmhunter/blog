* Added a JFET component to the KiCad simulation library.

* Added info on [CAN bus mailboxes](/electronics/communication-protocols/can-protocol#can-controller-mailboxes).

* Added a new page on [Hashes](/programming/hashes).

* More info added on the [MQTT Paho library](/electronics/communication-protocols/mqtt-protocol).

* Added a section on [Ring Oscillators to the Oscillators page](/electronics/components/oscillators/#ring-oscillators). Added simulation results for a three stage ring oscillator.
