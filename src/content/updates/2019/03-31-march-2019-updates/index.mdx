<ul>
  <li>New <a href="/programming/website-design/domain-name-servers-dns">Domain Name Servers (DNS) page</a>.</li>
  <li>New review on different serialization formats (e.g. CSV, JSON, TOML, XML, YAML). This can be found at the <a href="/programming/serialization-formats/a-comparison-of-serialization-formats">A Comparison Of Serialization Formats page</a>.</li>
  <li>NinjaCalc was moved from paid GoDaddy shared Linux hosting to my free Netlify hosting. Not only does this make the build/deploy step much easier (Netlify automatically builds and deploys when changes are pushed to <code>master</code>), but it also saves me money! After this blog was converted from Wordpress to Hugo and also moved to Netlify a few months ago (see the [Site Migration To Hugo Complete post](/updates/2018/12-15-site-migration-to-hugo-complete/) for more info), I no longer have any need for the GoDaddy server, saving approx. US$150 per year!</li>
  <li>
      Added new "shuriken" feature to posts and pages. You can now click on the shuriken to "upvote" content! You can get more information on the [Adding Shurikens post](/updates/2019/03-10-adding-shurikens/).

  
<Image src={import('./shuriken-icon.png')} width="100px">+1's, likes, thumb's up and claps have been done before, this blog uses shurikens!</Image>
  </li>
  <li>Added a <a href="/space/qgis">QGIS page</a> (open-source, free-to-use GUI software to working with geospatial images) with information on how to add tile servers, start multiple instances of QGIS and more.</li>
  <li>
    Updates to the quaternion page, including:
    <ul>
      <li>A new quaternion to rotation matrix calculator <a href="/mathematics/geometry/quaternions/">Quaternions page</a>.</li>
      <li>Info on converting from quaternions to rotation matrices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Updates to the <code>img</code> shortcode so that it also works with <code>.gif</code> images.</li>
</ul>
