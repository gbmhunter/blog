It's been quite a while since I've updated, been busy with other things. November 5th has come and gone, and currently I"m getting some movies of some fireworks I let of. Ummmm...well I've now added a new kind of salute, called a polumna. Check it out in the Salute section. I also added a few more definitions. Evilgecko signing off...

(PS - please tell me if there are any broken links, I've changed quite alot around lately and there's bound to be some dead links.) Signing off for real this time...
