## Removed Umami Analytics

The Umami analytics server ([this post](/programming/website-design/running-umami-on-aws-lightsail/) explains how I set it up) was costing me about US$6 each month, and it was a pain to maintain (it was crash every few months). I figured I got enough value from the time it was running --- I now have an approximate ratio of the actual traffic that is reported via a platform that ad blockers ignore (Umami) vs. that via a platform that gets blocked (Google Analytics). So I decided to remove it. Now I'm back to using Google Analytics.
