Here is the complete changelog:

## Added

- Added the ability to add timestamps to the start of each line of received data. Timestamps can be enabled from the Settings->RX Settings menu.
- Added the ability to select the default background, TX text and RX text colors from the Settings->Display menu. ANSI escape code colors commands will override these defaults. This also means you can color TX and RX text differently.
- Added a "Clear app data and reload app" button to the Settings->General Settings menu which clears all app data in local storage (e.g. profiles, settings changed from their defaults) and reloads the app.
- Added a local echo status indicator to the bottom toolbar.
- Added support for receiving tab characters and handling them correctly with tab stops.
- Added a small "Copy all text" button to each terminal which copies all the text in that terminal (including the scrollback buffer) to the clipboard.
- Added autoscroll lock on TX setting to the Settings->Display menu. When enabled (the default), the TX terminal and TX/RX terminals will automatically scroll to the bottom when the user presses a key inside the terminal.

## Changed

- Improved the way app data stored in the browser's local storage is updated to the latest version.
- Reordered the left-hand toolbar icons so that the "Show the terminal" button is now the first one.
- Made the logo in the left-hand toolbar a button which opens the terminal.

## Fixed

- Run unit tests (vitest) in CI after discovering they were not running.
- Fixed broken unit tests.
- Tooltip entry delay issues fixed in the quick settings accordion.
