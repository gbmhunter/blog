title: Electronics Section Migration Complete
type: updates
---

The electronics section has been completely migrated from Drupal to Wordpress. Also learnt plenty about Wordpress in the process, now getting the hang of image galleries and how to layout pages correctly (I've been having problems with text wrapping around images).

Shouldn't take much more to get the rest of site back online! I hope...
