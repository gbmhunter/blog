title: Drupal Site Fully Migrated!
type: updates
---

Finally, a few weeks after I started, the old Drupal site has been completely migrated to Wordpress. Lets hope it stays this way for a while! The amount of content is getting to a point where converting it from one CMS to another becomes a rather tedious task (100's of pages + media) :-). Tidying up and link fixing still needs to happen before I'll be happy with the conversion, but already it's probably better than the old Drupal site. No more errors!
