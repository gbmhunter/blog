NinjaCalc has a new calculator, a "Two Coordinate Geodesics" calculator (UPDATE 2024-02: URL now unavailable) that can help you analyse properties of two coordinates/points on the earth's surface (defined by latitude/longitude).

Given two points in latitude/longitude form (both degrees and radians supported), the calculator can give you the great circle (shortest) distance between the two points, and the initial/final bearings. This calculator can also find an intermediate coordinate/point between the two coordinates, given a fractional amount (such as 0.5). All of these properties are calculated using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

All these properties are shown on a interactive model of the earth in 3D (the sphere can be rotated).

This calculator can be found in the NinjaCalc web app at ... (UPDATE 2024-02: URL now unavailable).
