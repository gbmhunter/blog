* Removed the hyperlink underlining from all images inserted into posts/pages with the Wordpress media manager by tweaking the theme's style.css file.

* Moved the Communication Protocols page from under Electronics->Circuit Design to sit directly under it's parent Electronics.

* Columbus radio project complete! See more on the [Columbus Radio project page](/electronics/projects/columbus-radio).

* Updates to the [Time Measurement Systems page](/programming/general/time-measurement-systems).

* New page on [Vacuum Tubes](/electronics/components/vacuum-tubes) under Electronics->Components.

* Begun to use Embedly to embed PDFs into pages throughout this site.

* Moved info from the PCB Design page to a new child page called [Pads, Vias And Holes](/pcb-design/pads-vias-holes). Added information to this page about direct-connect vs. thermal-relief style pad/via connections.  
  

<Image src={import('./pads-with-direct-connect-and-thermal-relief.png')} width="440px">The pad on the left has a direct-connect style to the surrounded polygon pour, while the pad on the right has a thermal-relief connection style.</Image>

* Installation of the [Easy FancyBox Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/) which should make images throughout the site look much better when clicked upon.

* New section called [Removing Exposed-Pad Vias That Are Automatically Added By The Footprint Wizard](/electronics/general/altium/altium-tricks-and-standards/#removing-exposed-pad-vias-that-are-automatically-added-by-the-footprint-wizard) added to the Altium Tricks And Standards page.

* Information added to the Time Measurement Systems page about [Leap Smears](/programming/general/time-measurement-systems#leap-smears).

* Additions to the Power Management page about [UVLO (under-voltage lockout).](/electronics/circuit-design/power-management#uvlo-under-voltage-lockout)

* Added info about [Low-capacitance TVS diodes](/electronics/components/diodes/tvs-diodes/#low-capacitance) to the Diodes page.

* New page, [Arithmetic Operators, under Programming->Languages->C.](/programming/languages/c/arithmetic-operators)

* Added information about the atomicity of the C language's increment and decrement operators.

* Information added to the Diodes page about [Steering Diodes](/electronics/components/diodes#steering-diodes).

* New page, [Bootloaders](/programming/bootloaders/).

* New page, [Inheritance](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/inheritance), under Programming->Languages->C++.

* New page, [Switch Statements](/programming/languages/c/switch-statements) added under Programming->Languages->C.

* New page, [Managing Large Repos](/programming/version-control-systems/mercurial/managing-large-repos) under Programming->Version Control Systems->Mercurial.

* New page, [Managing Large Repos](/programming/version-control-systems/git/managing-large-repos) under Programming->Version Control Systems->Git.

* New page, [Inrush Current, under Electronics->Circuit Design.](/electronics/circuit-design/inrush-current)

* New page, WSON Component Package, under PCB Design->Component Packages.

* New info regarding [leakage currents and insulation resistance](/electronics/components/capacitors#leakage-currents) to the Capacitors page.

* More "How To's" on the [Drawing Schematics With TikZ And CircuitikZ page](/programming/languages/tex/drawing-schematics-with-tikz-and-circuitikz).

* More information about thermal relief and direct connections to the [Pads, Vias And Holes page](/pcb-design/pads-vias-holes#direct-connect-vs-thermal-relief) under PCB Design.
