#### Split Battery Page

The Lithium Thionyl Chloride and Zinc-Air battery pages have been split from the main Batteries page into their own pages. This was done to match the other battery chemistries.

#### Embedded Template Library (ETL)

Added info on the [C++ Embedded Template Library (ETL)](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/cpp-on-embedded-systems/#the-embedded-template-library-etl).

#### nRF Connect for VS Code

Added info on [nRF Connect for VS Code](/programming/microcontrollers/nordic/nrf-connect-for-vs-code/).

#### I2S Communication Protocol

Added info on the [I2S Communication Protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2s-communication-protocol/).

#### Cover Images

Added cover images to many pages, especially those in the [Communication Protocols section](/electronics/communication-protocols/).

#### Added Ability To Add Page Aliases

I added the ability for document pages to specify aliases. Aliases are great when you are moving pages around and the existing page is linked (and has a significant amount of traffic) from external sites. These aliases are added to each `.mdx` documents front matter like so:

```mdx title="src/content/pages/my-page.mdx" {2}
---
aliases: [/my-old-page/]

title: My Page
type: page
---

This is my page!
```

This field is specified in the content collection so it becomes available in the `.data` object when inside the `getStaticPaths()` function. To specify it in the collection's schema, add the following to the `src/content/config.ts` file:

```ts title="src/content/config.ts" {4}
const pagesCollection = defineCollection({
	type: 'content',
  schema: ({image}) => z.object({
    aliases: z.array(z.string()).optional(), // Used to setup dynamic redirects. This is done in [...slug].astro 
    authors: z.array(z.string()),
    date: z.date(),
	  description: z.string().optional(),
    draft: z.boolean().default(false),
    image: image().optional(),
    lastUpdated: z.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
    title: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

Then, in the `[...slug].astro` file which contains the `getStaticPaths()` function which determines the routes for the site, I check if the page has aliases and if so, add them to the static paths array. Alias paths are passed a `aliasTo` prop which is used to redirect to the correct page:

```astro title="src/pages/[...slug].astro" {13-27, 45-48}
---
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const combinedCollection = await getAllCollections();
  const routablePages = getRoutablePages(combinedCollection);
  const sidebarData = getSidebarData(combinedCollection);

  let staticPaths = [];
  for (let pageRoute of routablePages) {

    //...

    // Need to create additional paths if the page contains aliases in it's front matter
    const aliases = pageRoute.data.aliases;
    if (aliases) {
      for (let alias of aliases) {
        staticPaths.push({
          params: { slug: alias },
          props: { 
            aliasTo: pageRoute.slug,
            // Nothing more is needed for the alias page
            frontmatter: undefined,
            render: undefined,
            sidebarData: undefined,
          },
        });
      }
    }

    staticPaths.push({
      params: { slug: pageRoute.slug },
      props: { 
        aliasTo: undefined,
        frontmatter: pageRoute.data,
        render: pageRoute.render,
        sidebarData: sidebarData,
      },
    });
  }

  return staticPaths;
}

const { aliasTo, frontmatter, render, sidebarData } = Astro.props;

// Check if this page is an alias, and if so, redirect before attempting to render page
if (aliasTo) {
  return Astro.redirect(`/${aliasTo}/`);
}

#### Created a Programming > Design Section

I decided that the `Programming > General` section was somewhat mis-labeled (what is "General" mean anyway?). Some of the pages under this section seemed to fit a "Design" section, so I created a new section called `Programming > Design`. As a start, the pages on state machines have been moved across.

#### Added Info on GNU Linker Scripts

Added info on [GNU Linker Scripts](/programming/compilers/gcc/gnu-linker-scripts/).

#### Added New Optocoupler Schematic Symbols

Added new schematic symbols for [bidirectional phototransistor optocouplers](/electronics/components/optical-isolators/#bidirectional-phototransistor-opto-isolators).
