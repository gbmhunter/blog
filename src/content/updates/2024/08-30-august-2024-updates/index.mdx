#### Load Dumps

Added [info on TVS diodes](/electronics/components/diodes/tvs-diodes/#automotive-load-dump-clamping) used in automotive applications to protect against alternator "load dumps".

#### Inline Imports

Converted the separate "import then Image component" style images in MDX pages to inline imports.

#### Child Page Images

Added images to the child page links shown on parent pages.

#### Astro Content Collections

Moves all updates into their own Astro content "collection", rather than being mixed in with the pages collection.

#### Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)

Added information on the [Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)](/electronics/communication-protocols/trivial-file-transfer-protocol-tftp/).

#### Cover Image Aspect Ratios

Experimented with different image aspect ratios for page cover images. The main aspect ratios I tested were 4:3 (old TV), 16:9 (HD), and 1.91:1 (recommended by Facebook for sharing). Eventually I settled on using the 16:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1280x720px.

#### On/Off Controller ICs

Added info on [on/off controller ICs](/electronics/components/on-off-controllers/).

<Image src={import('./_assets/on-off-controllers-screenshot.webp')} width="800px" userClass="red-glow" />

#### chown

Added info on [chown](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/chown/).

<Image src={import('./_assets/chown-screenshot.webp')} width="800px" userClass="red-glow" />
