Added [info on TVS diodes](/electronics/components/diodes/tvs-diodes/#automotive-load-dump-clamping) used in automotive applications to protect against alternator "load dumps".

Converted the separate "import then Image component" style images in MDX pages to inline imports.

Added images to the child page links shown on parent pages.

Moves all updates into their own Astro content "collection", rather than being mixed in with the pages collection.

Added the most recent 10 updates to the home page underneath the main content links:

<Image src={import('./_assets/updates-on-homepage-screenshot.webp')} width={800} />

Added information on the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).

Experimented with different image aspect ratios for page cover images. The main aspect ratios I tested were 4:3 (old TV), 16:9 (HD), and 1.91:1 (recommended by Facebook for sharing). Eventually I settled on using the 16:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1280x720px.

Added info on [on/off controller ICs](/electronics/components/on-off-controllers/).

Added info on [chown](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/chown/).
