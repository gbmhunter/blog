## IEEE 2030 Smart Grid Interoperability Communication Protocol

Added information about the [IEEE 2030.5 Smart Grid communication protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/ieee-2030-5-smart-grid/).

## Makefiles

Added information on [changing directory](/programming/makefiles/#changing-directory) and [detecting the operating system](/programming/makefiles/#os-detection) in a [Makefile](/programming/makefiles/).

## Cellular

Added information on [LPWAN (cellular comm. protocols designed for embedded devices/IoT)](/electronics/communication-protocols/cellular/), including LTE Cat M and LTE Cat NB (NB-IoT).

## Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

Added information on the [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](/electronics/communication-protocols/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/), including network hierarchy, versions, and traps.

## Running GitLab Pipelines Locally

Added information on how to [run GitLab pipelines locally](/programming/version-control-systems/gitlab/) using the `gitlab-ci-local` tool.

## Added a Astro.js Table Component

To support data-rich tables in `.mdx` files, I created a `Table` component.

The `Table` component allows you to pass in the data as a Javascript object, and it will automatically create the headers and rows from this.

## Using Dev Containers for Firmware Development

Added information on how to use [dev containers for firmware development](/programming/firmware/using-dev-containers-for-firmware/).

## Add Info on ESP32 and ESP-IDF

Added info on [ESP32 SoCs and ESP-IDF](/programming/microcontrollers/espressif/esp32/).

## Added Equation Referencing Support

When moving from MathJac to Katex (as part of the move from Hugo to astro.js), I lost the ability to reference equations from within text as Katex does not support the `\label` and `\ref` commands with automatically numbered equations.

To get around this, I add `\htmlId{}{}` markers in the Katex and implement the reset of the logic for equation referencing in the client-side `IRefClientScript.js` script (which already does the figure and table referencing).

## Added Resistor Node Analysis Info

Added a [convoluted resistor network example](/electronics/components/resistors/#node-analysis) to show how to analyse the nodes in a resistor network to determine whether resistors are in series or parallel.

## Added Info on Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws

Added a new page on [Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws](/electronics/circuit-design/kirchhoffs-circuit-laws/).

## Added Info on Google Cloud

Added a new page on [Google Cloud](/programming/cloud/google-cloud/), including info on Firebase.

## Fixed Missing Square Root Symbols

I discovered this month that square root symbols were not rendering in any equations across the site. After much digging, I found at that this was because some Starlight CSS was messing with the svg used to render the square root symbol.

The offending CSS from Starlight was:

```css
.sl-markdown-content :is(img, picture, video, canvas, svg, iframe):not(:where(.not-content *)) {
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

Specifically, it is the `height: auto;` which selects `svg`. Katex uses an `svg` to draw the square root symbol in equations (many other parts of the equation are not `svg`, which is why you may not notice anything is amiss!). I added the following CSS to `custom.css` to fix this:

```css title="custom.css"
/**
This CSS fixes issue where \sqrt{} was not being rendered in Katex, due to a Starlight Css svg height rule
*/
.katex-html svg {
  height: inherit;
}
```
