[NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/) went through 11 releases from [v4.12.1](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm/releases/tag/v4.12.1) to [v4.19.0](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm/releases/tag/v4.19.0). Some significant features were added, after it got turned into a PWA just before the start of 2024. It has 75 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm) and had 3.1k page views (as reported by Google Analytics).

[NinjaCalc](https://ninjacalc.mbedded.ninja/) went through 2 releases from [v3.5.2](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaCalc/releases/tag/v3.5.2) to [v3.5.4](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaCalc/releases/tag/v3.5.4). These were minor releases which just fixed a broken URL and added the Umami analytics functionality. It has 30 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaCalc) and had 52k page views (as reported by Google Analytics).

[CppLinuxSerial](https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppLinuxSerial) went through 1 release from [v2.8.1](https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppLinuxSerial/releases/tag/v2.8.1) to [v2.8.2](https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppLinuxSerial/releases/tag/v2.8.2). This added changes to the CMake build system to allow `add_subdirectory()` to work correctly. It has 387 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppLinuxSerial).

Blog page views were based on a combination of [Umami](/programming/website-design/running-umami-on-aws-lightsail/) and Google Analytics. Umami was used were data was available due to it not being blocked by ad blockers, otherwise Google Analytics was used. Google Analytics values were adjusted to "Umami" values based on the average difference between the two. The average difference was calculated over all months that both were available. <IRef iref="tbl-2024-page-views" /> shows the page views for each month from the different analytics services. These were used to create <IRef iref="fig-stats-graphs" />.

## Blog Word, Page and Image Counts

At the end of 2024 the site had 704k words, up from 639k words last year (an increase of 65k). These words were spread over 1313 pages (up from 1221 pages last year), and included 3,222 images (an decrease of 1,296 from 4,518 images images last year). Even though many new images were added last year, the total dropped because I purged all of the redundant images that were still hanging around in the `public/` directory from when the site was migrated away from Wordpress.

## Achievements in 2024

* The blog was migrated from Hugo to Astro.js. I'm really happy with the change, as Astro.js component syntax is much clearer than Hugo's, and Astro.js lets me use React components if needed (I use React on a number of other projects).
* I fully embraced the `.webp` image format (which has great compression size), and almost all new raster images are now in this format. `.svg` is still used for vector images.
* Site-wide search was added to the blog. This became easier to implement after the migration to Astro.js.
* Added a "cover image" feature to each page. Each page can now have a cover image assigned to it (a piece of metadata in the frontmatter). This cover image is used in the parent page's "child pages" section to display beside the page description. It is also used for the social media preview image.
* Added figure, table and equation numbering support (I had this in Hugo, but lost it when migrating to Astro.js).
* NinjaTerm got heaps of new features added, after it got turned into a PWA just before the start of 2024.

## Plans For The 2025 Year

* Add more content to the blog (as always!).
* Keep adding features to [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/).
* Make sure CppLinuxSerial can work with CMake's `FetchContent` feature (it's an easy way to include external dependencies).
