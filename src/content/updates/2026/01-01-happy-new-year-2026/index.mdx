[NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/) went through 11 releases from [v4.19.0](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm/releases/tag/v4.19.0) to [v5.8.2](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm/releases/tag/v5.8.2) during 2025. This includes the jump to v5 which is a major change from being a web app to an Electron-based desktop app. It has 101 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm) and the app was started (based of the custom `app_start` event in Google Analytics) 3.2k times (since v5.0.0 was released).

[NinjaCalc](https://ninjacalc.mbedded.ninja/) went through no new releases in 2025. It has 34 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaCalc) and had 51k page views (as reported by Google Analytics).

## Blog Word, Page and Image Counts

At the end of 2025 the site had 794k words, up from 704k words last year (an increase of 90k). These words were spread over 1382 pages (up from 1313 pages last year), and included 3,222 images (an decrease of 1,296 from 3,222 images images last year).

## Achievements in 2024

* The blog was migrated from Hugo to Astro.js. I'm really happy with the change, as Astro.js component syntax is much clearer than Hugo's, and Astro.js lets me use React components if needed (I use React on a number of other projects).
* I fully embraced the `.webp` image format (which has great compression size), and almost all new raster images are now in this format. `.svg` is still used for vector images.
* Site-wide search was added to the blog. This became easier to implement after the migration to Astro.js.
* Added a "cover image" feature to each page. Each page can now have a cover image assigned to it (a piece of metadata in the frontmatter). This cover image is used in the parent page's "child pages" section to display beside the page description. It is also used for the social media preview image.
* Added figure, table and equation numbering support (I had this in Hugo, but lost it when migrating to Astro.js).
* NinjaTerm got heaps of new features added, after it got turned into a PWA just before the start of 2024.

## Plans For The 2025 Year

* Add more content to the blog (as always!).
* Keep adding features to [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/).
* Make sure CppLinuxSerial can work with CMake's `FetchContent` feature (it's an easy way to include external dependencies).
