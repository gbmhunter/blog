2025 saw 282k (282,000) page views for [blog.mbedded.ninja](https://blog.mbedded.ninja). This is down from 505k last year, a decrease of 223k or 44%. That's quite the drop! AI is the likely culprit, with less people visiting the site due to just using AI to answer technical embedded engineering questions, and AI powered search summaries (i.e. the one Google uses) which means the user does not need to visit the site. <IRef iref="fig-stats-graphs" /> shows the page views and other key stats per year.

[NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/) went through 11 releases from [v4.19.0](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm/releases/tag/v4.19.0) to [v5.8.2](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm/releases/tag/v5.8.2) during 2025. This includes the jump to v5 which is a major change from being a web app to an Electron-based desktop app. It has 101 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaTerm) and the app was started (based of the custom `app_start` event in Google Analytics) 3.2k times (since v5.0.0 was released).

[NinjaCalc](https://ninjacalc.mbedded.ninja/) went through no new releases in 2025. It has 34 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaCalc) and had 51k page views (as reported by Google Analytics).

## Blog Word, Page and Image Counts

At the end of 2025 the site had 794k words, up from 704k words last year (an increase of 90k). These words were spread over 1382 pages (up from 1313 pages last year), and included 4,042 images (an increase of 820 from 3,222 images images last year). Note that I discovered a bug in the stats calculation code which was excluding `.webp` images from the total image count. I fixed this for the 2025 year, so the increase from last year will be inflated due to missed images in years prior.

## Achievements in 2025

* NinjaTerm got a major update to v5, which is a major change from being a web app to an Electron-based desktop app. This allows for a more feature rich app as it is no longer restricted by the browser's sandbox. This has allowed for improvements such as showing the user more serial port information, adding serial over BLE support, serial over socket support, and more.

## Plans For The 2026 Year

* Add more content to the blog (as always!).
* Keep adding features to [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/).
