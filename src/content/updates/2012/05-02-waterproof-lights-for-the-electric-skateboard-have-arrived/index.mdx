title: Waterproof Lights For The Electric Skateboard Have Arrived
type: updates
---

The waterproof LED lights that I had ordered from [Deal Extreme ](http://www.dealextreme.com/)months ago finally arrived. I already had one of these brought a long time back for playing around with, but needed another two for the skateboard. The plan is to mount two facing the front, and cover the remaining one in a red filter of some sort and make it rear-facing. They run directly of 12V, and are easily mounted.
