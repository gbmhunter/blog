<WarningIsNotes />

Also called Power Line Carrier Communication (PLCC). A "power line" can be any cable that distributes power, including mains (120-240VAC), the +12V from the battery in a car, or the DC power supply rails on embedded circuitry.

An example circuit for the LM1893 from Texas Instruments.
