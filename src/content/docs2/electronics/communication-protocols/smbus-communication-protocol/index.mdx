## Overview

SMBus is an acronym for **System Management Bus**. The SMBus is a derivative of the I2C bus, however there are enough changes that it warrants it's own page.

## History

SMBus was originally created by Intel in 1995.

## Official Specifications

The official specifications for the SMBus can be found at [http://smbus.org/specs/](http://smbus.org/specs/).

## Comparison With I2C

## Similarities

* Both use pull-up resistors (or constant-current sources) with an open-drain drive methodology.
* Both use the names SCL and SDA to the clock and data lines, respectively.
* Both use a 7-bit address with a 1-bit read/write bit to determine what slave to communicate with.
* Most I2C devices can communicate with SMBus devices (see the section Compatibility With I2C).

## Differences

* The SMBus operates at frequencies between 10-100kHz, while the I2C bus can reach into the MHz.
* SMBus devices are designed to that no leakage current occurs through SDA and SCL when the devices power is turned off.

## Compatibility With I2C

I2C and SMBus devices can communicate with each other in most situations. However, both devices have to operate within 10-100kHz.
