## Inverting Buck-Boost Converters

An inverting buck-boost is a type of switch-mode power supply (SMPS) that converts an input voltage into a higher or lower output voltage. It is given the name inverting because it generates a negative output voltage.

### Output Voltage

Again, the output voltage for an ideal SEPIC is purely determined by the input voltage and the duty cycle $D$, as given in the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
V_{OUT} = -\frac{D}{1 - D} V_{IN}
\end{align}
$$

To give you an idea of how varying the duty cycle can produce either a higher or lower output voltage, see the below image which shows how the output voltage can vary from a small fraction of $V_{IN}$ to many times larger than $V_{IN}$, and they are equal when the duty cycle is set at 50%.

As the duty cycle approaches 100%, the ideal output voltage approaches infinity! In practise, non-idealities and component absolute maximums limit the the output voltage to something in the range of 10x the input voltage.
