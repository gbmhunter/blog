## Overview

_Switched integrator ICs_ are integrated circuits (ICs) that are designed to convert very small currents into larger voltages by the process of integration. The integration occurs by feeding the input current into a capacitor for a known time period.

A switched integrator IC is an alternative to using a transimpedance amplifier for measuring the current through a photodiode. However, they are far less common than a standard transimpedance amplifier. This could be due to their extra complexity, cost and reduced bandwidth, with marginal gains in SNR at low frequencies[^burr-brown-transimpedance-vs-switched-int].

A switched integrator IC usually consists of an op-amp, input connection and output discharging switches (realized with MOSFETs) and a precise small capacitor (in the range of 10-100pF).

## Examples

### IVC102

The IVC102 is a "precision switched integrator transimpedance amplifier" by Burr Brown (now Texas Instruments)[^burr-brown-ivc102-ds].

### ACF2101

The _ACF2101_ is a "low noise, dual switched integrator" by Burr Brown (now Texas Instruments). It has two independent channels for converting a small input current into a larger output voltage[^burr-brown-acf2101-ds].
