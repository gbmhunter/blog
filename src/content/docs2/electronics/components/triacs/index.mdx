## Overview

A TRIAC is a 4-layer semiconductor device that conducts current in either direction when given a signal.

The name TRIAC is a generic trademark and is an abbreviation of _TRIode for Alternating Current_. The formal names for a TRIAC are _bidirectional triode thyristor_ or _bilateral triode thyristor_, although these names are rarely used.

## Schematic Symbol

The schematic symbol for the TRIAC is shown below:

The anodes A1 and A2 may be called Main Terminal 1 (MT1) and Main Terminal 2 (MT2) respectively.

## Component Parameter Descriptions

**Repetitive Peak Off-State Voltage (50-60Hz)**

The maximum repetitive peak voltage ($V_{DSM}$) allowed across the device. Remember that RMS voltage readings need to be multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$ to find the peak voltage (assuming a sinewave).

**Non-repetitive Off-State Voltage**

The maximum off-state peak voltage across A1 and A2 that is non-repetitive. Normally this is defined to pulses less than 10ms wide.

## Gate Currents

A "normal" TRIAC might have a gate trigger current ($I_{gt}$) of 20-50mA. A "sensitive" TRIAC might have an $I_{gt}$ of 2-10mA.

## Part Numbering

Many TRIACs begin with/include the three-letter term _BTA_.
