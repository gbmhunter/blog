## Overview

_Signal diodes_ (a.k.a. _small signal diodes_) are designed for rectification of low power signals rather than the higher power electronics that general purpose diodes are designed to rectify. Although they can't handle high currents or high reverse voltages, they benefit from being able switch faster and therefore more suitable for higher frequency operation. Signal diodes are built in two different ways:

* Point contact diode
* Glass passivated diode
