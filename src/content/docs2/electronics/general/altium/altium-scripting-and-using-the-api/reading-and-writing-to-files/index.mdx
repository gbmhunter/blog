## Overview

You have the ability to write to and read from files inside Altium scripts. This can be useful for saving user configuration data that persists between each time the script is run, or providing input/output data for a particular script that needs to interact with the operating system.

The objects of interest are `TIniFile`.

`TIniFile` is great for storing category-key-value (or just key-value) information.

## INI Files

## Creating An INI File

You can create an INI file by using:

```
var myIniFile
myIniFile = TIniFile.Create(fileName)
```

where `fileName` is an absolute path string to the file you wish to create (e.g. `C:\Users\MyUser\test.ini`).

<Aside type="note">
"Create" is a little misleading. If the file already exists, this function performs more like "open for editing". It **does not** delete any information already present in the INI file.
</Aside>

## Reading And Writing To INI Files

### Booleans

You can write a boolean-based data point using:

```
iniFile.WriteBool category, key, trueFalse
```

where `category` and `key` are `strings`, and `trueFalse` is a `boolean.

You can read a boolean-based data point from an `INI` file using:

```
Dim myBool
myBool = myIniFile.ReadBool(category, key)
```

## Strings

Similarly to writing a boolean, you can write a string-based data set using:

```
iniFile.WriteString category, key, value
```

where `category`, `key` and `value` are all strings. This will create an INI file which looks like this: 

```
[category]
key=value
```

You can read a data set from an INI file using:
    
```
value = iniFile.ReadString category, key
```

Have a look at the file [UserData.vbs](https://github.com/gbmhunter/AltiumScriptCentral/blob/master/src/UserData/UserData.vbs) in the [AltiumScriptCentral repo on GitHub](https://github.com/gbmhunter/AltiumScriptCentral) for INI file read/write examples.
