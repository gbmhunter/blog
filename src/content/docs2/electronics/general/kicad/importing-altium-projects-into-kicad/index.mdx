## Overview

If you are wondering if you can import Alitum PCB projects into KiCAD, and how to do it, then you've come to the right place!

## Use The Built-In Import Tool To Convert the PCB File

As of May 2020, the built-in import tool is only available in the nightly builds, and only supports the conversion of the `.PcbDoc` file (the board layout), to the `.kicad_pcb` format. It does not support the import of shcematic files. For importing the schematics we will rely on the 3rd party `altiumtokicad` tool (more on this later).

In PcbNew (KiCADs board routing tool), click _File->Import->Non KiCAD Board File_. Then select _Altium Designer PCB Files (*.PcbDoc)_ from the lower-left dropdown, and then select the Atlium PCB file that you want to import. The tool should take care of the rest!
