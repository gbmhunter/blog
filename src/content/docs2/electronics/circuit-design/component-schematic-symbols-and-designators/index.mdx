## Overview

Component designators and schematic symbols are used to quickly identify components both on schematics and PCBs. They usually consist of a short acronym representing the type of component, followed by unique number to distinguish it from other components of the same type (e.g. `R3`, `R4`, `C3`).

Over the years, many standards have been released that specify particular designator prefixes for component types. These include:

* Australian Standard AS1102:1995 (Graphical symbols for electrotechnology)
* IEC 60617
* IEEE 315-1975.

However, many schematic and PCB silkscreen designs do not strictly follow any standard (although the similarities are usually quite high). The following list shows non-standard specific, commonly used acronyms and the type of component they represent.

## List of Common Component Designators And Symbols

Sorted by alphabetic order.

### Antennas (ANT)

There are a number of different schematic symbols for an antenna, but they all look similar and should be easily recognizable. The designator `E` is also used, however `ANT` is my personal preference.

Designator(s):

* `ANT` (recommended)
* `E`

Recommended schematic symbols(s):

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
{/* {{% figure src="antenna-symbol-open-top.svg" width="100px" caption="A schematic symbol for an antenna with an open top." %}} */}
<Image src={import('./antenna-symbol-open-top.svg')} width="100">A schematic symbol for an antenna with an open top.</Image>
{/* {{% figure src="antenna-symbol-closed-top.svg" width="100px" caption="A schematic symbol for an antenna with an closed top." %}} */}
<Image src={import('./antenna-symbol-closed-top.svg')} width="100">A schematic symbol for an antenna with an closed top.</Image>
</div>

### Assemblies (A)

Separate assembly or sub-assembly (e.g. daughter board). I do not see this designator used much in practice (and I myself have never used it, for things such as GPS modules with an LGA footprint I have always used the designator `U`).

Recommended designator(s):

* `A`

### Batteries (BT)

The designator `BT` is commonly used for a battery. The schematic symbol shown below is typical for a battery, although sometimes the distinction between a single-celled and multi-celled battery is made. If the battery is single-celled, this can be represented by a symbol with only one pair of long/short lines (representing the two electrodes of the cell). If the battery is multi-celled, two pairs of long/short lines with a dotted line connecting them (representing many plates) can be used. I prefer to just use the below symbol for any battery type.

Recommended designator(s):

* `BT`

Recommended schematic symbol(s):

{/* {{% figure src="battery-symbol.svg" width="200px" caption="The schematic symbol for a battery." %}} */}
<Image src={import('./battery-symbol.svg')} width="200">The schematic symbol for a battery.</Image>

### Capacitors \(C)

`C` is the recommended designator for capacitors (both polarised and non-polarised). Sometimes you will see `VC` used for a variable capacitor (these are not common). I recommend using two different schematic symbols, flat plates for a non-polarised capacitor, and one plate which is curved for a polarised capacitor.

Recommended designator(s):

* `C`

Recommended schematic symbol(s):

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
{/* {{% figure src="capacitor-symbol-unpolarized.svg" width="200px" caption="The schematic symbol for a non-polarised capacitor." %}} */}
<Image src={import('./capacitor-symbol-unpolarized.svg')} width="200">The schematic symbol for a non-polarised capacitor.</Image>
{/* {{% figure src="capacitor-symbol-polarized.svg" width="200px" caption="The schematic symbol for a polarised capacitor." %}} */}
<Image src={import('./capacitor-symbol-polarized.svg')} width="200">The schematic symbol for a polarised capacitor.</Image>
{/* {{% figure src="capacitor-symbol-variable.svg" width="200px" caption="The schematic symbol for a variable capacitor." %}} */}
<Image src={import('./capacitor-symbol-variable.svg')} width="200">The schematic symbol for a variable capacitor.</Image>
</div>

Recommended parameters to show on the schematics:

* Capacitance (e.g. `10uF`)
* Voltage (e.g. `16V`)

For special high tolerance (e.g. 1% or less) capacitors it can be useful to show the tolerance also.

### Diodes (D)

The designator `D` can be used for most diodes. Sometimes `Z` is used for a Zener diode, and `LED` for a light-emitting diode, however TVS, Schottky and general purpose diodes are still just `D`.

Recommended designator(s):

* `D`

Recommended symbol(s):

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>

### Ground (GND, AGND, DGND)

Sometimes `GND` is used for all ground points, and sometimes grounds are split based on noise boundaries such as `AGND` and `DGND` (this is common in high-frequency circuits).

Designator(s):

* `GND`: For general purpose use.
* `AGND`: Specialised analogue ground.
* `DGND`: Specialised digital ground.

</div>

### Integrated Circuits (U)

`U` is the designator for integrated circuits. ICs include microcontrollers, liner voltage regulators, op-amps, e.t.c.

Why `U`? One theory is that `U` was the the designator for anything "Unspecified". It makes sense that when ICs first came into use that they would of been labelled as such. The name stuck, and now `U` is used for ICs (and no longer for anything "unspecified"). Another theory is that `U` stood for "Unrepairable"[^bib-ics].

In older schematics you may also see `IC` or `Z` used for integrated circuits.

Recommended designator(s):

* `U`

Recommended schematic symbol(s):

{/* {{% figure src="integrated-circuit-schematic-symbol-u1.png" width="200px" caption="Recommended schematic symbol for an integrated circuit (IC)." %}} */}
<Image src={import('./integrated-circuit-schematic-symbol-u1.png')} width="200">Recommended schematic symbol for an integrated circuit (IC).</Image>

### Jack (J)

A jack/socket/female connector. Also defined in IEEE 315 as the least moving part of a connector set (which also includes a plug, `P`).

Recommended designator(s):

* `J`

### Jumper (JP)

Jumper or link (L is for inductor, not link). This maybe a simple piece of wire, a physical jumper component, or perhaps a \(0\Omega\) resistor).

Recommended designator(s):

* `JP`

### Inductor (L)

`L` is used as a designator for inductors. This is probably in honour of the physicist Heinrich Lenz who was a pioneer in the discovery of electromagnetism (and because `I` is commonly used to represent current).

Recommended designator(s):

* `L`

### Motor (M)

Recommended designator(s):

* `M`

### Mechanical Part (MP)

A mechanical part. This is an umbrella term for many different things, such as screws, standoffs, brackets, e.t.c.

Recommended designator(s):

* `MP`

### Plug (P)

A plug/male connector. Also defined in IEEE 315 as the most moving part of a connector set (which also includes a jack, `J`).

Recommended designator(s):

* `P`

### Photovoltaics/Solar Panels (PV)

`PV` is the designator for photovoltaics (aka solar panels).

Recommended designator(s):

* `PV`

### Resistors (R, VR)

Sometimes you will see `LDR` for light-dependent resistors. For more info see the [Resistors page](/electronics/components/resistors).

Recommended designator(s):

* `R`: Standard 2-pin resistors
* `RN`: Resistor networks (more than one resistor in the same package, sometimes sharing a common connection).
* `VR`: Variable resistors (aka potentiometers or rheostats). I have seen the reverse, `RV` is use before, along with `POT`. 

Recommended schematic symbol(s):

import resistor_schematic_symbol_r1 from './resistor-schematic-symbol-r1.png'
import variable_resistor_potentiometer_schematic_symbol from './variable-resistor-potentiometer-schematic-symbol.png'

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>

<Image src={variable_resistor_potentiometer_schematic_symbol} width="250">The schematic symbol for a variable resistor (potentiometer).</Image>
</div>

### Switches (S, SW)

`S` is the designator used for a switch. `SW` is also commonly used. Sometimes you will see switches labelled according to their type (e.g. `PB` for push-button switches, `DPDT` for double-pole double-throw switches), **but this is not recommended**.

Recommended designator(s):

* `S`

### Spark Gap (SG)

Recommended designator(s):

* `SG`

Recommended schematic symbol(s):

{/* {{% figure src="spark-gap-schematic-symbol-triangular-200um-no-bom.png" width="200px" caption="A schematic symbol for a spark gap. This spark gap is created with two triangles of copper on the PCB, with a gap of 200um between them. As this is made purely from the PCB, there is no BOM component needed." %}} */}

This spark gap is created with two triangles of copper on the PCB, with a gap of 200um between them. As this is made purely from the PCB, there is no BOM component needed.</Image>

### Transformer (T)

Designator(s):

* `T` (recommended)
* `TF` ([^bib-an-component-designators])

### Transistors (Q)

Typically, `Q` is used for all transistors, no matter if they are BJTs, MOSFETs, JFETs, e.t.c.

Designator(s):

* `Q` (sometimes `Q` is also used for an integrated circuit, but I prefer using `U`)

Recommended schematic symbol(s):

{/* {{% figure src="transistor-symbols.svg" width="700px" caption="Schematic symbols for a variety of different transistor types. Showing the circle around the BJT or the body diode of the MOSFET is personal choice, however I do recommend showing the MOSFET body diode so you don't forget it's there when designing a circuit!" %}} */}

Recommended designator(s):

* `TP`

### Wire/Cable (W)

Wire/cable.

Recommended designator(s):

<Image src={import('./varistor-symbol-mov.svg')} width="200">Schematic symbol for a varistor (e.g. MOV) (recommended).</Image>

## Regex

The regex pattern to match any valid component designator, which is one or more capital letters followed by one or more numerals, is:

```text
^[A-Z][A-Z]*[0-9][0-9]*$
```

The above pattern also contains the start and end-of-line anchors `^` and `$`, to enforce that there is no text before or after the designator. These can be removed if desired. More on using regex with component designators can be found on the [Altium Scripting page](/electronics/general/altium/altium-scripting-and-using-the-api).
