## Overview

Small-signal analysis can be used to find the input/output impedances of various sections of circuitry.

## Small-Signal Analysis Method

1. **Find the quiescent point (DC operating point) of the circuit**. Remove all signal sources, leaving the DC supplies, and find the DC voltages and currents at each node in the circuit.

1. **Linearize the non-linear circuit components at the DC operating point**. The most basic example of this is a diode, whose current is approximately proportional to the square of the voltage across it. But as long as the signal is small (hence the name, small-signal analysis!) compared to the DC operating point of the diode, you can approximate this to a linear relationship, i.e. $ \Delta V = \Delta I R$. This resistance is called the _dynamic resistance_.

1. **Find the small-signal solution**: Now the DC sources are removed. Voltage sources are replaced with $0\Omega$ resistors (short circuit), current sources are replaced with $\infty \Omega$ resistors (open circuit). The signal sources are re-introduced and then finally node voltages and currents are solved using easy linear equations.

Taking it a step further: The complete solution is just the sum of the DC operating point + the small-signal solution.

## Analysis Of A Resistor Divider

We assume Vin is a perfect voltage source, therefore we can replace it with a short.

These two resistors are now in parallel, we can re-arrange the circuit as below to clearly show this:

The two resistors in parallel can be replaced with a single equivalent resistor (remembering $ R_{parallel
} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} $):
