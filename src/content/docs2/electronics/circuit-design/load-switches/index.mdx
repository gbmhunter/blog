## MOSFET Based

The following image shows a [MOSFET](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/) based high-side switch:

### BJT Current Sink Driving P-Channel MOSFET Load Switch

A simple resistor divider can be used to provide the correct $V_{GS}$ to turn on a P-channel MOSFET based load switch, however that only works well if the $V_{IN}$ is known and stays at fixed voltage. If it doesn't, then the resistor divider provides a varying $V_{GS}$, which could either turn the switch the MOSFET off at lower input voltages, or exceed $V_{GS(max)}$ at higher input voltages ($V_{GS(max)} = \pm 20V$ for most MOSFETs).

A better option in this case is to use a BJT current sink to set the desired $V_{GS}$ across a resistor, as shown in the following diagram:

import bjt_current_source_to_turn_p_channel_on from './_assets/bjt-current-source-to-turn-p-channel-on.webp'

<Image src={bjt_current_source_to_turn_p_channel_on} width="700">Rather than using a simple resistor divider to provide the necessary gate-source voltage to turn on a P-channel load switch, you can use a BJT current sink, which has the added benefit of providing a constant Vgs over a wide range of input voltages.</Image>

We assume the BJT ($Q_1$) is switched with $+3.3V$ coming from a microcontroller or similar. The BJT is configured to be a simple current sink, with the current given by:

$$
\begin{align}
I_C &= \frac{V_B - 0.7V}{R_E} \\
    &= \frac{3.3V - 0.7V}{2.7k\Omega} \\
    &= 1mA
\end{align}
$$

This current goes through $R_1$, which provides the necessary $V_{GS}$ to turn the P-channel MOSFET ($Q_2$) on:

$$
\begin{align}
V_{GS}  &= -I \cdot R_1 \\
        &= -1mA \cdot 10k\Omega \\
        &= -10V
\end{align}
$$

$R_G$ is added as good standard practise to limit gate current and gate voltages. In the above example, $V_{IN}$ can vary from approx. 11V right up to the maximum allowed drain-source or collector-emitter voltages (for example, $48V$), whilst keeping $V_{GS} = -10V$.

## IC Based

The following image shows an IC based high-side switch.

Some load-switches have reverse-polarity protection. More information of how they exactly implement reverse-protection with only the one MOSFET can be found in the [The Substrate (Body) Connection section of the MOSFET page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/index.mdx#the-body-effect-and-connecting-the-substrate-to-the-source).

**Be careful, some ICs which look like high-side load switches with built-in current protection are not actually suitable for switching a load**. One example is the Maxim MAX15162 _8V to 60V Smart Dual 1.5A Circuit Breaker with Accurate Current Monitoring_ IC ([datasheet here](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX15162.pdf)).

As highlighted in the below screenshot of it's datasheet, during start-up it only supplies an average of 28mA to the load, even though the part is designed to pass up to 1.5A during normal operation[^bib-maxim-max15162-ds]. If $V_{OUT}$ doesn't climb to equal $V_{IN}$ within 250ms during start-up, it times out. So any significant resistive load on the output that drew more than 28mA but less than 1.5A would always cause this IC time out during start-up. **This suggests that it is designed to work in tandem with an external high-side switch that is placed between this circuit breaker IC and the load**. If the high-side switch is kept off whilst the circuit breaker IC start-up, it will only have capacitance to charge up on it's output, hence the 28mA will be ok (up to a max. capacitance, and explain how to calculate this in the datasheet).
