## Overview

_Voltage-to-current converters_ are circuits which **convert an input voltage into an output current**. The output current is usually proportional to the input voltage, over some suitable range.

Many of these circuit designs use op-amps. Please see the [Op-Amp page](/electronics/components/op-amps) for more general information on operational amplifiers.

## Howland Current Source

The Howland current source is an op-amp based voltage-to-current converter.

For the circuit to work correctly, three pairs of resistors have to be equal:

$$
\begin{align}
R_1 = R_3, R_2 = R_4, R_S = R_{S'}
\end{align}
$$

Given the resistor equations above are satisfied, the load current is given by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
I_{LOAD} = \frac{V_{IN}}{R_S}(\frac{R_2 + R_S}{R_1})
\end{align}
$$

The output impedance is given by the equation (note that this does not depend on the above resistor equality equations to be satisfied):

$$
\begin{align}
Z_{OUT} = \frac{R_3 R_{S'}(R_1 + R_2)}{R_1 (R_4 + R_S) - R_3 (R_2 + R_{S'})}
\end{align}
$$

The Howland current source is commonly used to build a [4-20mA current-loop transmitter](/electronics/communication-protocols/4-20ma-current-loops).
