## RC Snubber

* Non-dissipative
* Passive

## How To Choose R And C

Choose a capacitance that is larger than the circuit capacitance. Choose R to match the impedance of the LC components.

## External Resources

[Snubber Circuits: Theory, Design and Application](http://www.electro-tech-online.com/custompdfs/2009/02/slup100.pdf) by Philip C. Todd is a good read.
