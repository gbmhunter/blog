## The Challenge

import luxcity_tonic_logo_small from './luxcity-tonic-logo-small.png'

<Image src={luxcity_tonic_logo_small} width="320px">The Luxcity Tonic logo.</Image>

To design and build a sequencing control system for 64 solenoids that controls a mixture of UV tonic and air into a manifold of pipes to be pumped around a structure. This was for a team participating in the Luxcity Project ([http://stajegrouparchitects.wordpress.com/](http://stajegrouparchitects.wordpress.com/)), or news articles

## Repository

The repo for this project can be found on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) at [https://bitbucket.org/gbmhunter/luxcity-tonic-uv-control-system](https://bitbucket.org/gbmhunter/luxcity-tonic-uv-control-system). It contains the firmware and datasheets.

## The Hardware

## 8x FreeTronics 8-Channel Relay Driver Shields

import arduino_8_ch_relay_channel_02 from './arduino-8-ch-relay-channel-02.jpg'

<Image src={arduino_8_ch_relay_channel_02} width="250px">The Freetronics 8-channel relay driver shield for the Arduino.</Image>

* Manufacturer: [Freetronics](http://www.freetronics.com/)  
* Store URL: http://www.freetronics.com/products/relay8-8-channel-relay-driver-shield
* Datasheet: https://github.com/freetronics/RelayDriverShield8/blob/master/RelayDriverShield8.pdf
* Supplier: NiceGear

The I2C controlled shield provides 8 outputs that can drive standard relays. Being I2C controlled, it only uses 2-pins of the Ardunio. Luckily, the I2C address settings are 3-bit, meaning I could just control all 8 from a single I2C line. The boards feature the MCP23017 I2C expander IC ([datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21952b.pdf)).

## 64x SPDT 12V Relays

import n_64_12v_relays from './64-12v-relays.jpg'

<Image src={n_64_12v_relays} width="500px">64 12V relays.</Image>

* Manufacturer: Zhejiang Dongya Electric Co. Ltd.
* Supplier: [NiceGear](http://nicegear.co.nz/)
* Supplier Link: http://nicegear.co.nz/components/relay-spdt-sealed/
* Datasheet: [click here](http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/JZC-11F-05VDC-1Z%20EN.pdf)
* Rated Coil Load: 12V @ 37.5mA  
* Coil Resistance: 320Î©  
* Minimum Coil Load: 5V @ 10mA
* Operate Time: 20ms
* Release Time: 10ms

64 relays are needed to control the 62 tonic water/air solenoid valves (plus 2 spare). Since there was 64 of them, they needed to be cheap. These ones were brought for around NZ$3 each.

## 62x 12V Solenoid Valves

import n_12v_solenoid_valve_02 from './12v-solenoid-valve-02.jpg'

<Image src={n_12v_solenoid_valve_02} width="320px">A 12V solenoid valve. 62 of these were used to control the flow of UV-reactive tonic water or air through the pipes.</Image>

* Manufacturer: HR Products
* Supplier: HR Products
* Datasheet: ~~http://www.hrproducts.com.au/resources/Valves%20MV%20Series/MV80.pdf~~ (**as of Dec 2017, URL unavailable**)  
* Operating Voltage: 12V  
* Inrush Current: 320mA  
* Holding Current: 260mA  
* Power Consumption: 8W  
* Minimum Operating Pressure: 20kPA  
* Maximum Operating Pressure: 1250kPA

62 solenoids are needed to either allow tonic or air to flow into one of the 31 pipes. When I first received them, I had a horrible feeling as I blew in one end and the solenoid let air through with some resistance. This was until I realised that they have a minimum operating pressure of 20kPA.

import solenoid_minimum_operating_pressure from './solenoid-minimum-operating-pressure.png'

<Image src={solenoid_minimum_operating_pressure} width="500px"></Image>

## 1x Arduino Uno

* Manufacturer: [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/)
* Supplier: [NiceGear](http://nicegear.co.nz/)
* Supplier Link: ([click here](http://nicegear.co.nz/arduino-boards/arduino-uno/))

I decided to use the Arduino development environment for speed, simplicity, and pre-existing hardware/firmware. The USB cable was able to provide enough power to turn on all 64 relay lights and the LCD screen (including backlight), without causing an over-current fault.

## 2x Power Supplies

import twin_power_supplies from './twin-power-supplies.jpg'

<Image src={twin_power_supplies} width="320px">Twin 500W power supplies to turn on up to half of the relays and solenoids all at once.</Image>

* Manufacturer: EnerMax
* Product: TomaHawk2 500W ATX2.2 PSU
* Supplier: [MightyApe](http://www.mightyape.co.nz/)
* Product Page: [click here](http://www.mightyape.co.nz/product/ENERMAX-TOMAHAWK2-500W-ATX22-PSU/19760193/)
* Total Continuous Rated Power: 500W  
* Output Voltages: 12Vx2, 5V, 3.3V, -12V

A PSU is needed to power the 64 relays and solenoids. This gave me a scare when I first received it, as it was 'apparently' not working. After some research I discovered that I needed to short out the green wire on the main connector to ground before the PSU would turn on.

They quote that there are two +12V supplies, but when using a multimeter, there was no resistance between any of the +12V wires, so either a) they are lying, or b) the two +12V outputs are connected together internally.

## 1x Arduino LCD Screen Shield

import arduino_lcd_shield_02 from './arduino-lcd-shield-02.jpg'

<Image src={arduino_lcd_shield_02} width="320px">The Freetronics LCD shield for the Arduino. This was used to display running information to the user.</Image>

* Manufacturer: [Freetronics](http://www.freetronics.com/)
* Supplier: [NiceGear](http://nicegear.co.nz/)
* Product Page: ([click here](http://nicegear.co.nz/arduino-shields/freetronics-lcd-keypad-shield/))

It just so happened that the relay driver shields are mount-compatible with the LCD screen shield, as the driver shields only use analog pins 4 and 5 for I2C communication, and the LCD screen only uses digital I/O.

The LCD screen was one of easiest parts of this project to setup. Built in libraries for controlling an LCD are included in the Arduino IDE. It literally took about 5 minutes to get this working (see below).

## Vixen Software

import vixen_software_logo from './vixen-software-logo.jpg'

<Image src={vixen_software_logo} width="300px">The Vixen software logo. Image from http://www.vixenlights.com.</Image>

* URL: [http://www.vixenlights.com/](http://www.vixenlights.com/)
* License: Closed-source, free to use.

Vixen is a free PC-based sequencer designed for controlling lights. Although not open-source, it is very versatile, being built upon the .NET framework, and provides an API to build your own input/output plugins.

To get around the problem with Vixen not outputting cells with an intensity of 0 (the firmware can't recognise what output value is for what channel unless all 64 are output in the correct order), I made the minimum allowable intensity equal to 1, so that Vixen outputs a value for every cell at every time step, and the firmware looks for a non-one value.

After testing a solenoid valve with the system, the comms between the computer and Arduino dropped out when the solenoid was turned off. I realised that although the relay shield boards had protection diodes, I still needed to add some to the solenoid's (on the relay outputs), as this inductive kickback was coupling into the digital system. Luckily I had a string of 1N4003 diodes on hand...

The bottom-side of the prototype board, fully soldered. Notice the heavy duty rails that deliver the power to the relays/solenoids. Even with these thick lines of solder, when half (31) of the solenoids where turned on, the board got considerably warm around the PSU entry point.

The LCD screen working. This part was a breeze, it was an Arduino capable LCD shield, and there was a pre-written library for the firmware. It literally took less than 5 minutes to get working.

## Firmware

I firstly considered DMX Control (as described in a FreakLabs tutorial at http://freaklabs.org/index.php/Tutorials/Software/Light-Sequencing-and-Decoding-DMX-with-an-Arduino.html, **as of Dec 2017, URL unavailable**), but this required hacking the Ardunio software platform (specifically, the HardwareSerial.cpp file) to get the UART to work correctly. I found it more elegant to use the Vixen output plugin 'Generic Serial' instead, as this worked without any hacking.

The firmware can be found in the project repo under 'src' on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) at [https://bitbucket.org/gbmhunter/luxcity-tonic-uv-control-system](https://bitbucket.org/gbmhunter/luxcity-tonic-uv-control-system). Since there wasn't much to it (one file of around 320 lines or so, I have also shown it below. Note that changes may of been made to the src after this code below was posted, so always use the repo on BitBucket if you want to get the most recent code.
