<h2>Matrix Condition Number</h2>

<p>low condition number -> matrix is well conditioned<br />
high condition number -> matrix is ill conditioned</p>

<p>infinity -> matrix is singular (non-invertible)</p>

<p>A matrix that is not invertible has a condition number of infinity.</p>

<p>What does this mean in a practical sense? When using the formula $ \textbf{Ax = b} $, a matrix $ \textbf{A} $ with a high condition number is usually unsuitable when solving real-world problems, as it means that a small change in $b$ will result in a large change in $\textbf{x}$.</p>
