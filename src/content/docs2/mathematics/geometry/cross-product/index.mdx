<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The cross-product is a mathematical operation you can perform on two vectors in 3D space. The cross-product produces a vector which is orthogonal to both of the input vectors, which means it is also normal to the plane containing the two input vectors.</p>

<h2>Mathematical Symbol</h2>

<p>The cross product of vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is written as:</p>

$$
\vec{a} \times \vec{b}
$$

<h2>Defining Equation</h2>

<p>The cross product is defined by the formula:</p>

$$
\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = ||\vec{a}|| ||\vec{b}|| \, sin (\theta) \, \vec{n}
$$

<p className="centered">    where:<br />
    $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors<br />
    $\vec{n}$ is the vector which is normal to both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$</p>

<h2>Cross Product Properties</h2>

<p>The cross product of two vector always produces a vector which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is orthogonal to both input vectors (i.e. normal to the plane containing the input vectors).</li>
<li>Has a direction which is determined by the right-hand rule.</li>
<li>Has a magnitude which is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two input vectors.</li>
</ul>
