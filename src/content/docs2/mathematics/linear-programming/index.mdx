<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This page provides an introduction to linear programming, with examples which use GNU Linear Programming Toolkit C API.</p>

<h2>What Is Linear Programming Good For?</h2>

<p>Linear programming is good for **solving problems in the below form:</p>

$$  
maximise \\  
z = 3x_1 + 4x_2 + 7x_3 \\  
subject to \\  
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 <= 10 \\  
x_2 - 5x_3 =5  
$$

The <b>objective function</b> is the function we want to either <b>maximise or minimise</b>. In the above example, this is:

$$ z = 3x_1 + 4x_2 + 7x_3 $$

<p>$z$ is the value we want to maximise, and it is dependent on $x_1, x_2, ...$. The <b>constraints</b> are the equations which the solution is <b>"subject to"</b>. These are the following lines:</p>

$$
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 <= 10 \\  
x_2 - 5x_3 = 5
$$

<p>These limit the values of $x_1, x_2, ...$. You can also have bounds for these variables, such as:</p>

$$
10 < x_1 >= 30
$$

<p>However, these <b>bounds are just another way of writing a constraint</b>. In fact, the above bound can be written in constraint equation form as:</p>

$$
x_1 > 10 \\
x_1 <= 30
$$

<h2>GLPK</h2>

<h3>Building GLPK</h3>

<p>The GLPK source code can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/">https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/</a>. This then has to be compiled/built for your computer.</p>

<h3>Solving The Example In GLPK</h3>

<p>GLPK can either (where the structural variables, x1, x2, ... are allowed to vary continuously) or perform mixed-integer programming, where the structural variables must take on a integer number. A sub-set of mixed-integer programming is binary programming, where the structural variables are only allowed to be the integers 0 or 1.</p>

<h3>Silencing GLPK</h3>

<p>By default, glpk prints a small amount of information to the terminal when the solver is run. To silence this, call:</p>

```c
glp_term_out(GLP_OFF);
```
