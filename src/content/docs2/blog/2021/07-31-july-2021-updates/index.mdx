import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

## Updates This Month

* A new page on [Gas Discharge Tubes (GDTs)](/electronics/components/gas-discharge-tubes-gdts/), with schematic symbols, designators and examples.

* Added a new page (in notes format) on [Spark Gaps](/electronics/components/spark-gaps/).

* Added info on transient surge waveform specification, including a graph illustration the concept behind 8/20us and similar specifications:

* Moved Zener diode info into it's [own page](/electronics/components/diodes/zener-diodes/).

* Cleaned up many of the schematic symbols on this site for a consistent look and feel.

* Added a diagram showing the protection diodes common to most digital CMOS pins.
