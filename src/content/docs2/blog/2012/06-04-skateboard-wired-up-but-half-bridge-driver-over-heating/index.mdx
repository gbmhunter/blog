import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

Most of the skateboard wiring has been completed (9.5hours done on it today). The front, rear, and skirting lights work fine, but sadly, the half-bridge I.C. is overheating (even while it is idle). I don't know what the problem is yet.
