import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

The electronic online calculators have been upgraded! They now

* Have selectable engineering units
* Have a "Calculate What?" button, meaning you choose which variable you know, and which to calculate
* Features shading of the calculated variables, so you know which ones you have to type in yourself
* Has live calculating that re-calculates everytime you change something.
* Features a "variable diagram", which helps graphically explain the equation and what your calculating

The calculators now have their own ~~\[page\](/electronics/general/online-calculators)~~, which shows the collection of calculators that are used on the electrical pages of the ~~\[CladLabs site\](www.cladlabs.com)~~.
