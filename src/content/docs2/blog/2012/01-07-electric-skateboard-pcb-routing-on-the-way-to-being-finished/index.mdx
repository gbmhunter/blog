title: Electric Skateboard PCB Routing On The Way To Being Finished
type: post
---

import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

After going nuts on the Electric Skateboard project in the last week, I have nearly finished the PCB routing for the skateboard PCB, the first of two boards (the other is the remote PCB).
