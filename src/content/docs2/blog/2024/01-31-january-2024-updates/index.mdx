import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

* Added info on the [Law of Cosines](/mathematics/geometry/triangles/#law-of-cosines).

<Image src={import('./_assets/law-of-cosines-screenshot.png')} width="700px"></Image>

* Added info on the [Trigonometric Ratios](/mathematics/geometry/triangles/#trigonometric-ratios).

<Image src={import('./_assets/trigonometric-ratios-screenshot.png')} width="700px"></Image>

* Added the ability to do a site-wide search with the help of the pagefind library. At compile time, after hugo builds the site, pagefind is then run and creates a search dictionary that is downloaded to the client when they want to perform a search. All the searching happens client-side, no server is needed.

* Added more info on [Zephyr](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/), including semaphores, the polling API, workqueues, watchdogs and commons errors.

* Noticed that the inline equation text colour was different to standard text (thanks to a Bootstrap CSS file), so I added SCSS rules to style it correctly.
 
* Added info on the [non-standard use of MCU SPI peripherals to send data to WS8212 RGB LEDs](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/#ws2812-rgb-leds).

<Image src={import('./_assets/ws2812-non-standard-spi-usage.png')} width="700px"></Image>

* Added a new page with info on [real-time clock (RTC) ICs](/electronics/components/real-time-clock-ics/).

<Image src={import('./_assets/rtc-screenshot.png')} width="700px"></Image>

* Added more info on various [Zephyr peripheral APIs](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr/).
