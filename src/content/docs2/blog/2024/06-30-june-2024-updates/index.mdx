import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

I added the ability to change basic port settings in [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/app) from the right-hand drawer. This was a feature request by a user.

You now have the ability in [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/app) to send a break signal at the end of every line in a hex macro. This was another feature request by a user.

I added a page to this blog on how to [choose serial numbers for embedded devices](/programming/firmware/choosing-serial-numbers-for-embedded-products/). It shows the way to calculate the mathematical probability of a collision when using random numbers for serial numbers.

I added a page to this blog on [ANSI escape codes](/programming/ansi-escape-sequences/).
