## Statistics for 2022

2022 saw 384k (384,000) page views! This was up from 267k last year, an increase of 117k or 44%.

At the end of 2022 the site had 604k words, up from 536k words last year (an increase of 68k). These words were spread over 1168 pages, and included 4,319 images (and increase of 330 from 3989 images last year).

### Most Popular Pages

The top 10 most popular pages, ranked by number of page views:

_Programming_ related pages took the top spots of 1, 2, 3 and 5 (num. 4 was the homepage), with the first _electronics_ related pages coming in at positions 6, 8 and 9.

### Acquisition

As usual, most of the traffic was from organic search (e.g. Google search engine).

### Donations

In 2022 I added a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/gbmhunter) donation button. I wasn't expecting much (if anything), but some kind person donated $30 last year. I'll celebrate that!

## Plans For The 2023 Year

* **More content, and improving existing content**: As always!
* **Phase out Asciidoc pages**: Although Asciidoc gives me some nice features such as figure and table numbering, I'm worried enough about the future portability of the format to stick with ubiquitous markdown for now.
* **Add a dark mode**: It's easy on the eyes when the background is dark! I hope to follow the somewhat industry standard and add a dark mode toggle this year to the site.
