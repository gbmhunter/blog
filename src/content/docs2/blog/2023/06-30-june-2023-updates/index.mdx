import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

* Added information about [electrolyte leakage in electrolytic capacitors](/electronics/components/capacitors/#electrolyte-leakage).

import electrolyte_leakage_screenshot from './electrolyte-leakage-screenshot.png'

<Image src={electrolyte_leakage_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Fixed bug which resulting in the embedded circuitjs iframe's from being displayed correctly (unsure of what was caused the problem to occur in the first place).

* Added info on differences between ["solid" and "wet" tantalum capacitors](/electronics/components/capacitors/#solid-tantalum-capacitors).

import solid_wet_tantalum_capacitor_screenshot from './solid-wet-tantalum-capacitor-screenshot.png'

<Image src={solid_wet_tantalum_capacitor_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added a new `aside` shortcode for Markdown and changed the styling of the asides (called admonitions in AsciiDoc) so that the title and icon are a top-bar rather than a side-bar (looks better when there is longer content in the aside).

import aside_screenshot from './aside-screenshot.png'

<Image src={aside_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added info on the [TO-220-7 and TO-220-7C variants of the TO-220 component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-220-component-package/#to-220-7) family.

import to_220_7_screenshot from './to-220-7-screenshot.png'

<Image src={to_220_7_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added a new page on the [TO-206 component package family](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-206-component-package/).

import to_206_screenshot from './to-206-screenshot.png'

<Image src={to_206_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Fixed error where the `SOT-490` was incorrectly labelled as `SOD-490`.

* Added a new page on [Switching PSU Control Methodologies](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/control-methodologies/).

import smps_control_modes_screenshot from './smps-control-modes-screenshot.png'

<Image src={smps_control_modes_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added a new page on [Mid-Chip Solder Balls](/pcb-design/mid-chip-solder-balls/).

import mid_chip_solder_balls_screenshot from './mid-chip-solder-balls-screenshot.png'

<Image src={mid_chip_solder_balls_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added info on feedforward, standard form, series form, and diagrams to the [PID Control page](/programming/general/pid-control/).

import pid_parallel_form_screenshot from './pid-parallel-form-screenshot.png'

<Image src={pid_parallel_form_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added info on manual tuning to the [PID Control page](/programming/general/pid-control/), including a worked example.

import pid_manual_tuning_screenshot from './pid-manual-tuning-screenshot.png'

<Image src={pid_manual_tuning_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added more info on [SMD crystal packages](/pcb-design/component-packages/crystal-packages/), including the 7x5mm package.

import smd_crystal_screenshot from './smd-crystal-screenshot.png'

<Image src={smd_crystal_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>

* Added a new page on [Resonant LLC Converters](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/resonant-llc-converters/), a form of SMPS (switch-mode power supply).

import resonant_llc_converters_screenshot from './resonant-llc-converters-screenshot.png'

<Image src={resonant_llc_converters_screenshot} width="600px"></Image>
