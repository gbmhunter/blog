import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

* All image duplicates in `static/images/` were deleted. These duplicates were created back when the site was running on Wordpress due to it's image optimization strategies (creating a _pyramid_ of resolutions for the same image to best match the size of the image when it is rendered on a page).

* Addition of a `link` shortcode.

* Updates to many of the component package pages in the [Component Package Database](/pcb-design/component-packages).

* Addition of the [TO-273AA Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-273aa-component-package).

* Updates to the [Convolution page](/programming/signal-processing/convolution), including the addition of a worked example showing the calculation of the convolution between two "box-car" signals.

* I posted a link to the [A Comparison of Serialisation Formats page](/programming/serialization-formats/a-comparison-of-serialization-formats) to the [/r/programming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/bhq9c5/how_to_use_socketcan_with_the_commandline_in_linux/). I got a decent amount of feedback which helped improve the page and fix mistakes.
