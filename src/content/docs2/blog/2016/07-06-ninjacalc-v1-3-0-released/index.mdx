[NinjaCalc v1.3.0 has been released!](http://gbmhunter.github.io/NinjaCalc/) The biggest change is the addition of a **CRC calculator**, which allows you to calculate the CRC value for ASCII or hex data, using either **common pre-loaded CRC algorithms or your own custom algorithm**.

The **custom algorithm section** allows you to enter a CRC width from 1-64 bits, a CRC polynomial, initial value, XOR-out value, and whether the input data and/or the output CRC value is reflected. Then it will calculate the resultant CRC value.

**Either [download NinjaCalc v1.3.0 here](http://gbmhunter.github.io/NinjaCalc/)**, or open up your previous installation and click yes to update when prompted.

More information on CRC algorithms can be found on the [CRCs (Cyclic Redundancy Checks) page](/programming/general/crcs-cyclic-redundancy-checks).
