import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

* New info on [mains power connectors](/electronics/components/connectors/#mains-power-connectors).

* Updates to the [SPI Protocol page](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/) under Electronics->Communication Protocols.


import typical_spi_connections from './_assets/typical-spi-connections.jpg'

* New info on [PTC Type thermistors](/electronics/components/ptc-resettable-fuses/).

* Updates to the [D2PAK (TO-263) Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/d2pak-component-package/), with more info on the TO-263 THIN package.
