import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

* The TVS diode content from the [Diodes page](/electronics/components/diodes) was moved to it's own [child page](/electronics/components/diodes/tvs-diodes). Info on low-capacitance TVS diodes added to this page.

* Added sections to the [PTC Type Thermistor page](/electronics/components/ptc-resettable-fuses/) about PTC Thermistors vs. Fuses and how to calculate the triggered resistance.
