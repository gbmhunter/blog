First off, Happy New Year!

It's been a busy month around here! Most updates have been to the C++ and C language sections, as well as the new Linux->Programs section. Here are all the updates this month...

* New [Input And Output page](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/input-and-output) under C++ programming.
* New [Special Casts page](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/special-casts) under C++ programming.
* New page about [jQuery](/programming/website-design/jquery) under the Programming->Website section.
* New [sed page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/sed) under Linux.
* New [find page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/find) under Linux.

* New main menu! The old website menu was getting a bit cluttered, so I splurged out and brought the [Ubermenu by SevenSpark](http://wpmegamenu.com/) (US$19). It has much more features and allows me to do multi-level fly-out on all of the deeply nested pages.
