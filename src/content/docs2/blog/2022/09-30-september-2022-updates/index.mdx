## Updates This Month

* Create a new page for the [BJT common-collector amplifier](/electronics/circuit-design/bjt-common-collector-amplifier/).

* Updates to the [Kalman Filter page](/programming/signal-processing/digital-filters/kalman-filter/).

* Upgraded the Netlify build image from Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 (which is deprecated and was going to be unsupported in November 2022) to Ubuntu Focal 20.04. This initially caused a hugo build failure, which was resolved by adding `GEM_PATH` to the `security: exec: osEnv:` section of the `config.yaml`.

import adding_gem_path_to_config_yaml from './adding-gem-path-to-config-yaml.png'

<Image src={adding_gem_path_to_config_yaml} width="500px"></Image>

* Added info on [charge pump output impedance](/electronics/components/power-regulators/charge-pumps/).

import charge_pump_output_impedance_screenshot from './charge-pump-output-impedance-screenshot.png'

<Image src={charge_pump_output_impedance_screenshot} width="500px"></Image>

* Added a new page on [switched-capacitor circuits](/electronics/circuit-design/switched-capacitor-circuits/).

import switched_capacitor_screenshot from './switched-capacitor-screenshot.png'

<Image src={switched_capacitor_screenshot} width="500px"></Image>

* Converted the [Analogue Filters page](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/) from Asciidoc to Markdown.

* Added info on Elliptic filters.

* Added more info on [low-pass and high-pass Sallen-Key filters](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/sallen-key-filters/), along with simulated examples and info on their high-frequency limitations.

import sallen_key_screenshot from './sallen-key-screenshot.png'

* Moved the _PCB Design->PCB Manufacturing And Assembly Considerations_ page to _Electronics->Circuit Design->[The Schematic And PCB Design Guide](/electronics/circuit-design/the-schematic-and-pcb-design-guide/)_.

* Added a new page on [Switched Integrator ICs](/electronics/components/switched-integrator-ics/).

import switched_integrator_ics_screenshot from './switched-integrator-ics-screenshot.png'

<Image src={switched_integrator_ics_screenshot} width="500px"></Image>

* Updated the [C++ On Embedded Systems page](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/cpp-on-embedded-systems/) with more info and examples on what C++ features you should and shouldn't use in an embedded system. Also replaced a code example that was using a pointer to use a reference.
