import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

## Overview

First of, happy new year!

## Statistics

This year I decided to present the stats a little differently and made the infographic below.

import blog_eoy_2021_infographic from './blog-eoy-2021-infographic.png'

<Image src={blog_eoy_2021_infographic} width="700px">Blog statistics infographic for 2021. </Image>

The infographic image was made in "Canva" (an online diagram/image editing app). You can view the source image [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAExcXpjIzI/9u5e1myIuzQCf1Aw_PAmSQ/view?utm_content=DAExcXpjIzI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton).

## Updates

- Started the upgrade from CSS to SCSS (using hugo-extended).
- Started migrating from Markdown to AsciiDoc (using AsciiDoctor support provided by Hugo).
- Settled on a colour scheme and program (Affinity Designer) for drawing diagrams.
- Purchased both Affinity Designer (for making diagrams) and Affinity Photo (for touching up photos), and both have been well worth their one-of purchase price (take that, Adobe and your subscription model).
- Upgraded the main menu from hover style interface to an accordion style interface, making it more user friendly for people using touchscreen devices.
- Upgraded the base layout of every page to use Bootstrap responsive columns, rather than my own custom CSS to achieve the same level of responsiveness.
