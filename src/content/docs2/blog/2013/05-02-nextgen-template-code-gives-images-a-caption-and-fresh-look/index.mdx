title: NextGEN Template Code Gives Images A Caption And Fresh Look
type: post
---

import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

After playing around with the NextGen plugin PHP files and this sites CSS style file, I have created what NextGEN calls a "template" for a single picture (in NextGEN lingo, a singlepic), which adds a border and the caption to the image. Which by-the-way, is a feature that NextGEN lacks, and should implement themselves!

Here is what images look like now, with the custom template applied.

import cladlab_nextgen_custom_template_image_code_working from './cladlab-nextgen-custom-template-image-code-working.png'

<Image src={cladlab_nextgen_custom_template_image_code_working} width="500px">When the NextGEN custom template code works!</Image>

Which, IMO, is a big improvement over what they used to be. They now have a nice, semi-transparent border, and include a caption below the image (which is associated with the image in the NextGEN gallery page). This is what they used to look like:

import image_before_nextgen_caption_and_border_template_for_singlepic_added from './image-before-nextgen-caption-and-border-template-for-singlepic-added.png'

<Image src={image_before_nextgen_caption_and_border_template_for_singlepic_added} width="500px">What images used to look like before the NextGEN caption and border template was added.</Image>

But...it's not perfect...yet. As you can see below, in certain situations the images to go crazy.

import cladlab_nextgen_custom_template_image_code_not_fully_working from './cladlab-nextgen-custom-template-image-code-not-fully-working.png'

<Image src={cladlab_nextgen_custom_template_image_code_not_fully_working} width="650px">When the NextGEN custom template code isn't working correctly, this happens.</Image>

I am no full-time website designer. Playing with HTML objects like div's  and getting the right float setting, width, height, margin, alignment e.t.c can be a guestimate at the best of times. I will hopefully work out how to fix this sometime soon...

Note that this custom template has been disabled for the images in this post, otherwise you'd get the mirror-in-a-mirror look which would be utterly confusing.
