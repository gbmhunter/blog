## Overview

The SC-89 comes in two popular variants, the 3-lead `SC-89-3` and the 6-lead `SC-89-6`. The SC-89-3 is usually just labelled as `SC-89`, and can refer to either the [SOT-490 component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-490-component-package/) or the [SOT-416 component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-416-component-package/). For more info on the `SC-89-6`, see the [SOT-563 (synonym for the SC-89-6) page](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-563-component-package/).
