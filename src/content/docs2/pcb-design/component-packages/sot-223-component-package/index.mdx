title: SOT-223 Component Package
type: page

## Overview

SOT-223 is a family of SMD component packages commonly used for medium-power discrete semiconductor components and basic ICs such as linear regulators. It is characterised by standard gull-wing pins on one side of the body and a larger tab on the other side.

There are three main variants in the SOT-223 family:

* SOT-223-3 (3 pin excl. tab)
* SOT-223-4 (4 pin excl. tab)
* SOT-223-5 (5 pin excl. tab)

Members of the SOT-223 family are used for things such as MOSFETs, load switches, high-power linear regulators and current sources.

## Conflicting Naming Conventions

<Aside type="caution">
Some manufacturers use the term SOT-223-3 to refer to the 3-pin, 1-tab package, while others count the tab as a "pin", and so name it SOT-223-4. However this conflicts with the first lot of manufacturers who use the term SOT-223-4 to refer to the package with 4 pins and 1 tab. In summary, BE CAREFUL.
</Aside>

This page associates the x in SOT-223-x to stand for the **number of pins excluding the tab**. This is the most popular convention.

## SOT-223-3

The SOT-223-3 (TO-261AA) component package is the most common variant within the SOT-223 family. It looks similar to the SOT-23 package, but with a tab on one side instead of legs.

It is commonly used for medium-power linear regulators and load switches.

The tab is sometimes electrically connected to pin 2 (the middle pin on the other side of the package), or sometimes electrically isolated for all other pins and called pin 4. For example, the AZ1117I linear regulator from Diodes Incorporated connects the tab to pin 2:

### Thermal Resistance

Texas Instruments gives the following thermal resistance data for the SOT-223-3 package (taken from http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps7b6933-q1.pdf, **as of Dec 2017, URL is unavailable**).

All of the parameters in the above table were measured with the SOT-223-3 package soldered to a _JEDEC standard high-K profile, JESD 51-7, 2s2p four layer board with 2-oz copper_. The copper pad was soldered to the thermal land pattern.

### Standard Linear Regulator Pinout

The SOT-223-3 package is commonly used for small, medium-power linear regulators. There is a de-facto standard pinout that many manufacturers use when incorporating a linear regulator into the SOT-223-3 package:

### Standard Load Switch Pinout

The SOT-223-3 package is commonly used for smaller low and high-side load switches. As such, there is a de-facto standard pinout that many manufacturers use for load switches in the SOT-223-3 package:

## SOT-223-4

This variant can be confused with the three pin and one pad variant (SOT-223-3) if you decide to count the pad as well as the pins in the number.

As you can see, as the copper area increases, the thermal resistance decreases asymptotically to around $55^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$.
