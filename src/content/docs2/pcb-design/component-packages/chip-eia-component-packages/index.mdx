## Overview

Surface-mount resistors, MLCC capacitors and ferrite beads are commonly packaged in a set of standardised _chip_ packages. These package sizes are standardised by both the IEC in metric units and the EIA in imperial units.

<Aside type="note">
As much as I prefer the metric system, I've accepted that most people use the imperial codes when describing chip packages and use it myself also.
</Aside>

They are defined by four-digit number which represents the total footprint width and height, respectively (assuming the two footprint pads are on the left and right rather than the top or bottom, or more formally, the axis of the component runs parallel to the width).

In **metric** units, the format is to use two number each to describe the width and height in tenths of a millimeter, e.g. a chip package size '2012' tells you the width is 2.0mm and the height is 1.2mm. In **imperial**, the numbers are in hundredths of an inch (which is NOT mills -- that is thousandths of an inch). For example, an 0805 chip package tells you the width is 0.08inch, and the height 0.05inch. This is equivalent to the '2012' metric representation. Below is a short description on the most popular chip packages. The imperial size of the footprint is listed first, and then the metric equivalent is followed in brackets.

The following is a list of the common chip packages, sorted from smallest to largest:

## SMD Chip Resistors

The following table shows the range of chip resistors package sizes (based on the EIAJ Chip Packages above), and typical parameters for each. Note that the maximum current rating is based on the thermal properties of the package and its leads, and does not take into account the actual resistance of the resistor (e.g. tested with a 0Ω resistance). Obviously, the actual allowable current is likely to be much less due to resistance.

## Footprints

Every PCB CAD program worth it's weight in salt will provide footprints for the standard chip packages in their default libraries.

There are reports that the default 0402 (imperial) footprint that is shipped with Eagle is non-ideal and causes "head-in-pillow" and/or tombstoning. See https://www.worthingtonassembly.com/perfect-0402-footprint for more details[^worthington-perfect-0402-footprint].

## Reverse Geometry Chip Capacitors (LICC)

Reverse geometry chip capacitors (named _LICC_ (Low Inductance Chip Capacitor) by Kyocera AVX[^kyocera-avx-licc]) have their leads on the long sides of the chip, as opposed to standard chip components which have the leads on the short sides. This reverse geometry reduces the length of the current path through the component and **reduces the parasitic inductance of the capacitor** (less than 400pH[^tdk-reverse-geometry-mlcc]). For applications such as high-speed design, when capacitors are used for noise decoupling, the parasitic inductance needs to be as low as possible to increase the capacitors resonant frequency[^tdk-reverse-geometry-mlcc].

<Image src={reverse_geometery_chip_capacitor_photo_tdk} width="200px">A photo of a reverse geometry chip capacitor from TDKs C series[^tdk-reverse-geometry-mlcc-ds].</Image>

They are normally named the same as normal chip capacitors except with the two numbers in reverse order, i.e. an `0603` sized capacitor now becomes a `0306` capacitor.

## MEMS Oscillators

Some MEMS oscillators uses chip package sizes, but with extra pins for power and ground. One common package size is `2012` (2.0x1.2mm) which is sometimes used for 32.768kHz crystal oscillators (XTAL):
