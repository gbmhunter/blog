SOD-128 is a package used by a few manufacturers for diodes. I could not find any JEITA (EIAJ) code (e.g. SC-xxx) for this package. ST Microelectronics calls this package the SOD-128 FLAT (presumably because it has flat leads, as opposed to many SOD packages which by default have gull-wing leads, and only offer flat variants once you add a F suffix)[^bib-st-sm6fxxay-ds]. There does not appear to be any difference between the ST Microelectronics SOD-128 FLAT package and the SOD-128 as labelled by Rohm and Nexperia.

## Synonyms

* CFP5 (Nexperia)[^bib-nexperia-sod-128]
* PMDTM (Rohm Semiconductor)[^bib-rohm-rbr5lam30b-ds]
* SOD-128-2 (Mouser)[^bib-mouser-rb088lam-30tr]
* SOD-128 FLAT (ST Microelectronics)[^bib-st-sm6fxxay-ds]

## Thermal Resistance

* $R_{JA} = 200^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (standard land pattern, see below)
* $R_{JA} = 120^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (mounting pad for cathode 1cm²)
* $R_{JA} = 60^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (mounted on ceramic PCB with standard footprint)

## Dimensions

The main dimensions of the SOD-128 package are:

* Length (incl. leads, avg.): 4.70mm[^bib-rohm-rbr5lam30b-ds]
* Width (avg.): 2.50mm[^bib-rohm-rbr5lam30b-ds]
* Height (avg.): 0.95mm[^bib-rohm-rbr5lam30b-ds]

The below diagram shows these dimensions:

The land area is $21.1mm^2$ (6.2x3.4mm)[^bib-nexperia-sod-128].

## Common Uses

* General purpose diodes
* TVS diodes
