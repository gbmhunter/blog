## Overview

SMB is a SMD component package commonly used for diodes. The packages other common name is DO-214AA (diode outline 214AA). It is in the same family as [SMA (DO-214AC)](/pcb-design/component-packages/sma-do-214ac-component-package/) and [SMC (DO-214AB)](/pcb-design/component-packages/smc-do-214ab-component-package/). The common name, SMB, is not to be confused with SMD (surface-mount device, the common name for any surface-mount component).

SMB is relatively easy to solder by hand. Don't use a really fine tip, as the two pins need a fair amount of heat.

## Dimensions

The pitch of the SMB is 3.97mm (center of lead 1 to center of lead 2). The height of the component is 2.44mm.

The SMB package takes up a PCB land area of approximately $22.0mm^2 (5.59mm \times 3.94mm)$.
