## Overview

The TO-99 (Transistor Outline 99) is a 8-pin can-type through-hole component package. It is an older through-hole part which has been used for ICs, especially op-amps.

The dimensions of the TO-99 package are shown below. The pins are arranged of the circumference of a 2.54mm (0.1inch) radius circle with a pin placed every 45Â°. A metal tab indicates pin 8.
