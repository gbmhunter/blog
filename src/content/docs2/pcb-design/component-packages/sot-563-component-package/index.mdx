## Overview

`SOT-563` (Small Outline Transistor 563) is the JEDEC name for a 6-lead SMD component package. It is very small, and has a 68% smaller footprint than the popular [SOT-23](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-23-component-package/) package family.

The image below is a 3D render of the `SOT-563` package.

## Synonyms

* `DRL|6`, or `DRL0006A`: Texas Instrument's package code[^ti-sn74lvc1g97-configurable-gate-ds].
* `SC-89-6`: JEITA package code.

## Dimensions

The body is 1.6mm long (sides with the leads) and 1.2mm wide. The width including the leads is 1.6mm. It has a pitch of 0.5mm. The image below shows the dimensions for the `SOT-563` component package as defined by Texas Instruments.

## Recommended Footprint

The image below shows the recommended footprint for the `SOT-563` component package from Texas Instruments. It is 1.30mm long (sides with the leads) and 1.80mm wide, giving a PCB land area of $2.34mm^2$.
