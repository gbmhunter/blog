## Overview

_MSOP_ (Mini Small Outline Package)[^wikipedia-msop] is a family of SMD component packages with gull-wing leads. The family is a miniaturized version of the SSOP package. There are a few common variants in the MSOP family, the MSOP-8, MSOP-10, and MSOP-16.

The exposed pad on this package is optional (Analog Devices have separate codes for each).

## MSOP-8

_MSOP-8_ is the 8-lead variant in the MSOP family.

* uMAX: Maxim Integrated[^maxim-umax-8].
* uSOP: Maxim Integrated[^maxim-umax-8].

### Dimensions

The MSOP-8 body is 3x3mmm. When you take into account the length of the leads the body width extends out to 4.9 mm.

| Dimension Name         | Dimension Letter | Value  |
|------------------------|------------------|--------|
| Body length            | $D$            | 3.0 mm |
| Body width             | $E$            | 3.0 mm |
| Body width incl. leads | $H_e$          | 4.9 mm |
| Pitch                  | $e$            | 0.65 mm |

## MSOP-10

_MSOP-10_ is the 10-lead variant in the MSOP family.

### Synonyms

* MSE: Linear Technology/Analog Devices[^analog-mse-package].
* RM-10: Analog Devices, no pad.

### Dimensions

## MSOP-16

The MSOP-16 pitch is 0.50 mm which differs from the 0.65 mm used for the MSOP-8 and MSOP-10.
