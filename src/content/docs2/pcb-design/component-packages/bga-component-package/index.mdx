## Overview

BGA (Ball-Grid Array) is a high-density SMD component package which can have from 4 to 1700+ pins. Common pitches are 0.5mm, 0.8mm, and 1.0mm. BGA packages are used to either make components very small or to encompass a large number of leads. Some modern FPGAs have more than 1700 leads!

BGA usually requires reflow oven or infrared heater. Expert-level solderers can use the "dead-bug" prototyping method and attach super-thin wires to each ball when the package is upside down, but do not consider this a reliable or fast method! BGA packages require an x-ray machine to discover if the balls have correctly soldered onto the pads.

Common uses include:

* Microcontrollers
* FPGAs
* High-density SMD ICs
* CPUs
* GPUs
* Memory

## Ball Layout

A particular BGA package may not have a complete grid of balls. BGA packages also come in a _straight_ or _staggered_ ball layout.

## BGA Pad Diameter

The pad diameter for a BGA footprint can be determined by one of three methods:

* Maximum material condition (MMC)
* Least material condition (LMC)
* Percentage reduction of nominal ball diameter (e.g. 20%)

## Soldermask Considerations

## Variants

### DSBGA

DSBGA (Die Sized BGA) is the name given by Texas Instruments for their family of BGA packages in where the die size is the same as the package size. They are also known by the term Wafer-Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP). As of October 2015, they are available in 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, and 0.50mm pitches.

Texas Instruments also assigns a package code to each package within the DSBGA family. Here are some example (this is in no way an exhaustive list):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>TI Package Code</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>YDC</td>
      <td>DSBGA, 4 Leads, Pitch 0.5mm, Body 1.1x1.1mm, Height 0.4mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>YEA</td>
      <td>DSBGA, 5 Leads, Pitch 0.5mm, Body 0.9x1.4mm, Height 0.5mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>YEB</td>
      <td>DSBGA, 4 Leads, Pitch 0.5mm, Body 1.3x1.3mm, Height 0.625mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>YEC</td>
      <td>DSBGA, 6 Leads, Pitch 0.5mm, Body 1.8x1.3mm, Height 0.625mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>YZP</td>
      <td>DSBGA, 8 Leads, Pitch 0.5mm, Body 1.9x0.9mm, Height 0.5mm</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note that confusingly, the three letter Texas Instrument's code is **not unique** for a particular package. For example, the code "YZP" may refer to a 5, 6, or 8 ball DSBGA package, which also may have **different** height, width and length dimensions.
