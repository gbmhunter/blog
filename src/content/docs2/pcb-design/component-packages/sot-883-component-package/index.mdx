## Overview

`SOT-883` (Small-outline Transistor 883) is a 3-lead SMD component package that is very similar to a DFN package. It is also very similar to the [SOD-882 component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-882-component-package/) (note: that's `SOD`, not `SOT`!). It has the same outside dimensions as the `SOD-882`, except with the addition of an extra pad. This presumably explains the transition from `SOD` to `SOT` -- the two pin package is used for diodes, whilst this three pin package is used for transistors.

Synonyms:

* `CASE 506DB` (onsemi[^bib-on-semi-ntns3c68nz-ds])
* `DFN1006-3` (NXP[^bib-nexperia-sot-883])
* `SC-101` (JEITA, EIAJ)[^bib-nexperia-pbss2515m-ds]
* `XDFN3` (onsemi)

Package Dimensions:

* Length: 1.0mm (nom)[^bib-nexperia-sot-883]
* Width: 0.6mm (nom)[^bib-nexperia-sot-883]
* Height: 0.50mm (nom)[^bib-nexperia-sot-883]

Pitch:

* 0.35mm between the centers of the two small pads (called the nominal pitch by Nexperia)[^bib-nexperia-sot-883]
* 0.65mm between the centers of the small pads and the large pad (called the minimal pitch by Nexperia)[^bib-nexperia-sot-883]

Solderability: Almost impossible to solder with a hand-held soldering iron due to the pads being on the bottom of the package. Need to use reflow oven/hot air soldering techniques.

Typical PCB Land Area: $1.17mm^2$ (1.30x0.90mm)[^bib-nexperia-sot-883]

Common Uses:

* MOSFETs

Similar To:

* [DFN](/pcb-design/component-packages/dfn-component-package/)
* [SOD-882](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-882-component-package/) (2 pins instead of 3, in the same sized package)

onsemi (formally On Semiconductor) calls this package the `XDFN3`[^bib-on-semi-ntns3c68nz-ds]. However, you have to be careful as onsemi also uses the name `XDFN3` for slightly different packages, for example, the NTNS5K0P021Z MOSFET, which has a smaller package size of 0.62x0.42x0.4mm[^bib-on-semi-ntns5k0p021z-ds], rather than 1.0x0.6x0.5mm of the `SOT-883`. The key difference is the "case code" which is `CASE 506CB1`[^bib-on-semi-ntns3c68nz-ds] for the SOT-883, but `CASE 711BH`[^bib-on-semi-ntns5k0p021z-ds] for the smaller 0.62x0.42x0.4mm package.
