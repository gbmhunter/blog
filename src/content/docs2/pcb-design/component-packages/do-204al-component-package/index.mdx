## Overview

The DO-204AL (also commonly known as DO-41) component package is a very popular 2-lead through-hole package used for older diodes (incl. the famous 1N400x series[^vishay-1n4001-ds]). The pitch is typically 400mil, although because of the long through-hole leads, it is user variable. It is easy to solder by hand. The DO-41 package is normally used for higher power "rectifier" diodes, whilst the lower power "signal" diodes use smaller through-hole packages such as the DO-35. The typical rated current for a diode in this package is 1A.

## Synonyms

* **DO-204AL** (Diode Outline 204 Variant AL): Newer JEDEC name[^vishay-1n4001-ds]
* **DO-41** (Diode Outline 41): Older JEDEC name.
* **SOD-66**: NXP[^nxp-sod66]

## Thermal Resistance

Vishay gives the typical junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of a DO-204AL mounted to be $R_{\theta JA} = 50^{\circ C/W}$. This is when the DO-204AL is mounted horizontally on a PCB with a 9.5mm lead length. The junction-to-lead thermal resistance is $R_{\theta JL} = 25^{\circ C/W}$[^vishay-1n4001-ds].

This package is normally mounted on the PCB in two ways, either flat with the legs bent at 90° to fit into the holes, or in space-constrained applications, vertical, with one of the legs straight and one bent 180° to fit into the holes in the PCB (which are closer together than when in the flat orientation). Material of package is normally moulded plastic.

Weight of a diode in a DO-41 package is around 0.33g[^vishay-1n4001-ds].
