## Overview

The `TO-247` (Transistor Outline 247, JEDEC) is a family of large through-hole 3-leaded component packages commonly used for 3-leaded devices which dissipate a lot of thermal power, including BJTs and MOSFETs.

Variants:

* TO-247AC, TO-247-3 (3 leads)
* TO-247PLUS-3 (Infineon)[^bib-infineon-to247plus]
* TO-247PLUS-4 (Infineon)[^bib-infineon-to247plus]

Pitch: 5.45mm (0.215")[^bib-on-semi-package-change]

Solderability: Suitable for wave soldering. Easy to solder by hand.

Similar To:

* [TO-218](../to-218-component-package) (unlike the TO-247, this does not have an isolated mounting hole)

## TO-247AC (TO-247-3)

The `TO-247AC` (a.k.a. `TO-247-3`) is the 3-pin variant of the `TO-247` package. It is considered the "upgrade" of the `TO-218` (`SOT-93`), with the main difference being the insulated mounting hole, making it easier to mount to a heatsink without shorting things out (it is "mechanically compatible" with the `TO-218`, however not identical![^bib-on-semi-package-change]).

Synonyms:

* `SOD-429` (Nexperia)
* `CASE 340L-02` (On Semi)[^bib-on-semi-package-change]

Common Uses:

* BJTs
* MOSFETs

When containing a MOSFET, the pin wiring is usually:

1. Gate
2. Drain

## TO-247PLUS

The `TO-247PLUS` packages (`TO-247PLUS-3` and `TO-247PLUS-4`) are variants of the `TO-247` package by Infineon. The main difference is the removal of the mounting holes in the TO-247PLUS variants, plus some extended creepage distances for the TO-247PLUS[^bib-infineon-to247plus].
