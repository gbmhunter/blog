## Overview

`awk` is a UNIX-based program that is used to scan and modify text files. It commonly used to find and replace text in one or many files at once.

It could be seen as a more powerful version of [sed](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/sed), with a fuller programming language and better support for variables.

If you just want to search for text, and have no desire to edit it, it might be better (and safer!) to just use grep instead.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for a simple awk command follows:

```sh    
$ awk 'awk commands here' file.txt
```

Strings can be embedded within the 'awk commands here' section by using double quotes, e.g.:

```sh
$ awk 'awk_func("a string");' file.txt
```

## Find And Replace

To replace all occurrences of old_world with new_world in file.txt:

```sh    
$ awk '{gsub(/old_word/, "new_word")}; file.txt'
```

Using `gsub` (global substitution) instead of just `sub` will mean that all instances of `old_world` will be replaced.
