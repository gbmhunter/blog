## Command-Line

You can jump into the WSL by typing `wsl` inside a Windows terminal:

```powershell
wsl
```

It will jump into the WSL and set the current working directory to the same directory as in Windows, e.g. if you were in `C:\Users\username\` in Windows, when you type `wsl` it will land you at `/mnt/c/Users/username/`.

VS Code has an extension for WSL. It allows you write/run code inside WSL whilst editing in VS Code running in Windows (i.e. the same way VS Code supports remote development).

From inside WSL, if you type the command `code .`, it will open at VS Code in Windows and setup a remote development session into WSL at the current working directory.

```
wsl --shutdown
```

Must be run from terminal with Administrator privileges:

```
wsl --upgrade
```

You can set the default distribution with:

```
wsl --set-default <distro-name>
```

The default distribution is the one which will load if you just type `wsl` at the command-line in Windows.

## Upgrading From WSL 1 To WSL 2

If you first enabled/installed WSL a long time ago, you might be running WSL 1. WSL 2 is a big upgrade over WSL 1 -- WSL 1 used a "wrapper" to convert Linux system calls into Windows calls, whilst WSL 2 features a full Linux virtual machine (similar to VirtualBox).

## Passing Through USB Devices

WSL 1 and 2 do not natively support USB pass-through like VirtualBox does. However, there is a popular 3rd party tool called [usbipd-win](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) which can do the job. There was a update to WSL 2 to allow usbipd-win to work without too much hassle.
