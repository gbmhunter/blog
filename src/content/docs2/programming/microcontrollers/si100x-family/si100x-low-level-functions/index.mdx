## No Operation (NOP)

A nop is an instruction that does nothing. It it used to stall a cpu for precisely timed operations. It can be created by making a pre-compiler macro that executes the assembly code 0x00 as shown below

```c
// Macro
#define NOP() asm{0x00}

// Pause for two clock cycles
NOP();
NOP();
```
