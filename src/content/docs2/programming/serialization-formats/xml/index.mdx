## Overview

Over the recent years, XML has become increasingly popular in both traditional computer programming, and website design. One of it's big benefits is that it is both human and machine readable.

**Examples:**

* The Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) replaced WinForms and uses a version of XML called XAML for designing the graphical interface.
* XML is commonly as an encoding method to save user-generated files on your computer. Previous to XML , they were usually stored as binary files. The .docx extension for Word documents is one example.
* HTML is not exactly XML, but they are brother and sister. They both stem from a language called SGML.

## Comments

Comments in XML are started with `<!--` and finished with `-->`.
