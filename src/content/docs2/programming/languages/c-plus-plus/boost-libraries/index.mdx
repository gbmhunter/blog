## shared_ptr

<code>shared_ptr</code> stores a pointer to a dynamically allocated object. It performs reference counting and will call delete on the original object when the last shared_ptr pointing to the object is destroyed (or reset).

<code>shared_ptr</code> was included in the C++11 standard, as <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. It is recommended to use the standard library version unless backwards compatibility is required.

## Assertion `px != 0` failed

If you get the runtime error:

```c++    
Assertion px != 0 failed.
```

It usually means you tried to access the stuff the <code>shared_ptr</code> was pointing to before allocating it anything. This is the equivalent of trying to de-reference a raw pointer that is equal to null and getting a segmentation fault, except <code>shared_ptr</code> is smarter and checks this for you.
