## Prerequisites

* You are familiar with the command-line and you have access to a Linux/Mac OS, or you know how to tweak these commands where needed to run on Windows (you shouldn't need to change much)
* You have a modern version of GCC installed.

## The Hello, World Example

1. Create a new empty working directory and `cd` into it.

2. Create a new file called `main.cpp` with the following contents:

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)
        {
            std::cout << "Hello!\n";
        }
    }
    ```

3. Run the following command to compile/link your code into an executable:

    ```sh
    $ g++ main.cpp -o hello_world -fopenmp
    ```

4. Run the following command to run your program:

    ```sh
    $ ./hello_world
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```sh
    $ ./hello_world
    Hello!
    Hello!
    Hello!
    Hello!
    ```

The `#pragma omp parallel` macro told the compile to parallelize the code within the braces. A _team_ of 4 theads are created, as specified by `num_threads(4)`. These threads ran concurrently (and potentially in parallel if you have multiple cores) and each printed out `"Hello!"`.

You shouldn't see any mangling of the `"Hello!\n"` as a single stream operation (`<<`) is guaranteed to be atomic. However, we would run into a mess if we tried to do something like:

```c++
std::cout << "Hello, " << "world" << std::endl;
```

as there would be no guarantee that `"world"` will be printed directly after `"hello"`...another thread may grab control of `std::cout` and print something in-between (the same applies to the `std::endl`, which normally prints a `\n`).

`-fopenmp` told GCC to compile using OpenMP (otherwise the `#pragma ...` macro would of been ignored).
