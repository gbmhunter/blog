## Overview

Unlike many object-orientated languages such as C++ and C#, namespaces are not natively supported in JavaScript.

However, they can be "faked" in a number of different ways. One of the easiest is to enclose everything within a variable:
    
```js
var fakeNamespace = {

    NamespaceFunc1: function() {
    },

    NamespaceFunc2: function() {
    }
};

// You then call functions within it using the following syntax
fakeNamespace.NamespaceFunc1();
```

Notice though, you have to remember to include commas after every function or variable declaration. AND, you can't declare private objects. But it is the simplest solution.
