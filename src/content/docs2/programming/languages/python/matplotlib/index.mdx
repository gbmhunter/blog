## Importing

`matplotlib`, just like `numpy`, is one of those libraries which has so much legacy behind the import statement that it's worth breaking Python style rules and using the `at` keyword to change the name of the imported library. Traditionally, `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported as `plt`, with the statement:

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Using subplots

```py
# Create two plots, in a grid with 2 rows and 1 column
# (plots will be stacked vertically)
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)

ax1 = axs[0]
ax2 = axs[1]

# Use each axX object normally...
```

## Two Y-Axis Example

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)
y1 = x**2
y2 = np.sin(x)

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

ax2 = ax1.twinx()

ax1.plot(x, y1, color='g')
ax2.plot(x, y2, color='b')

fig.subtitle('Two Y-Axis Example')
ax1.set_xlabel('x')
ax1.set_ylabel('y1')
ax2.set_ylabel('y2')

plt.show()
```

This will produce the following graph:

import matplotlib_two_y_axis_example from './_assets/matplotlib-two-y-axis-example.png'

<Image src={matplotlib_two_y_axis_example} width="500px">Example matplotlib graph using two separate Y-axis.</Image>

## Matching The Legend Text Color To The Plot Line Color

It can be a handy visual aid to set the legend color to the same color as the corresponding line on the plot. This can be done with the following code:

```py
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y_x = x
y_2x = 2*x
y_3x = 3*x

ax.plot(x, y_x, label='$y = x$')
ax.plot(x, y_2x, label='$y = 2x$')
ax.plot(x, y_3x, label='$y = 3x$')

leg = ax.legend()

# Set legend text color to line color
for line, text in zip(leg.get_lines(), leg.get_texts()):
    text.set_color(line.get_color())

plt.title('Legend Text Color Matches Plot Line Color')

plt.savefig('legend-text-color-matches-plot-line-color.png')
```

This will produce a plot which looks like:

import legend_text_color_matches_plot_line_color from './_assets/legend-text-color-matches-plot-line-color.png'

<Image src={legend_text_color_matches_plot_line_color} width="700px"></Image>

## Creating Animated Plots

When using the `pillow` writer, the GIF will not loop. When using the `imagemagick` writer, the GIF will loop.

## Using The Basemap

<Aside type="caution">
As of 2016, `Basemap` has been deprecated. However, it is still a viable choice for plotting maps in Python/Jupyter.
</Aside>

```py
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
```

### Using A Specific Axis

Rather than `Basemap` automatically using/creating an axis for you, you can instead take a more object-orientated approach (which I recommend) and provide `Basemap` with the `Axis` object to use for drawing the map:

```py
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
map = Basemap(ax=ax) # Pass in the axis object to draw the basemap in
# Proceed as usual
```

### Adjusting The Size Of The Map

You can adjust the size of a basemap by calling `plt.figure(figsize(15,15))` before making any calls to the `Basemap` class:

```py
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize(15, 10)) # Adjust the size of the map
map = Basemap()
```

## Setting Aspect Ratio Equal For A 3D Plot

Unfortunately, there is no built-in support for forcing the aspect ratio to be equal for a 3D plot. However you can do it yourself by calculating a bounding box from your plot objects and setting the limits yourself. Below is a function you can copy/paste into your own code. Pass in the `Axes` object to set the aspect ratio to equal. Note that you have to add the objects to the axes **BEFORE** calling this function.

```py
def set_axes_equal(ax) -> None:
    """
    Make axes of 3D plot have equal scale so that spheres appear as spheres,
    cubes as cubes, etc..  This is one possible solution to Matplotlib's
    ax.set_aspect('equal') and ax.axis('equal') not working for 3D.

    Args:
      ax: A matplotlib axis object.
    """

    x_limits = ax.get_xlim3d()
    y_limits = ax.get_ylim3d()
    z_limits = ax.get_zlim3d()

    x_range = abs(x_limits[1] - x_limits[0])
    x_middle = np.mean(x_limits)
    y_range = abs(y_limits[1] - y_limits[0])
    y_middle = np.mean(y_limits)
    z_range = abs(z_limits[1] - z_limits[0])
    z_middle = np.mean(z_limits)

    # The plot bounding box is a sphere in the sense of the infinity
    # norm, hence I call half the max range the plot radius.
    plot_radius = 0.5*max([x_range, y_range, z_range])

    ax.set_xlim3d([x_middle - plot_radius, x_middle + plot_radius])
    ax.set_ylim3d([y_middle - plot_radius, y_middle + plot_radius])
    ax.set_zlim3d([z_middle - plot_radius, z_middle + plot_radius])

# Example usage below
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')

# Add objects for axis here...

ax.set_aspect('equal')
plt.show()
```
