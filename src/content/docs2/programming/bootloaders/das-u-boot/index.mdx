## Overview

Das U-boot (or just known as U-boot) is both a first and second-stage bootloader.

## Device Trees

U-boot supports the use of device trees (a description of the hardware configuration contained in a tree-style data structure). U-boot will pass the device tree blob (DTB) to the kernel at boot time.

## Usages

The ARM-based Chromebooks come preloaded with U-boot.
