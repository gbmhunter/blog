title: Stopping Un-wanted Modules From Appearing On The Search Page
type: page
---

import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

If you happen to have un-wanted modules appearing on the search page, you are likely to have the default layout set to 'Home'.

To fix this, go to the Admin panel, and navigate to System->Settings->Edit->Display and change the 'Default Layout' from 'Home to 'Default'.
