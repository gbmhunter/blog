## Overview

Express is a web application framework for node. The Express framework itself uses Connect for some of it's functionality, a middleware framework for node.

It's website is [http://expressjs.com/](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installing

You can install Express with NPM (node package manager) using the following command:

```sh    
$ npm install express
```

This will install express into the current directory under the standard node packages folder.

## Basic Web Server

The following code shows how to make a basic web server with Express. Notice how it is different from the basic web sever using plain node.

```js    
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.send('hello world');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

To run this, save the code as a `.js` file, and instruct node to run this file from the command line by typing `node filename.js`.
