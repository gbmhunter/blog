[Umami](https://umami.is/), aside from being a delicious savoury taste, is also an analytics platform. It is a popular alternative to Google Analytics and allows free use if you self-host the software on your own server. I decided to switch from Google Analytics to Umami because ad blockers were blocking the Google Analytics script used to keep track of the number of page visits and unique visitors to this blog, [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/) and [NinjaCalc](https://ninjacalc.mbedded.ninja/). By using Umami and self-hosting it, I could point a subdomain (e.g. `umami.mbedded.ninja`) at the server running Umami. There is a very high probability that ad blockers won't block the Umami client-side script since the data would now be sent to the same domain as this blog.

This page details how to get Umami setup and running on an AWS Lightsail server instance. AWS Lightsail is a simple and cheap way of hosting servers that don't need to do much processing. Lightsail costs around US$3.50 to $5.00/month for the small size instances that Umami can run on (for small to medium sized sites) using IPv6 only.

Credit goes to the Digital Ocean's tutorial at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-umami-web-analytics-software-on-ubuntu-20-04 for showing me how to do this for the first time. This tutorial expands on Digital Ocean's by adding Lightsail specific information, DNS information, and updating some parts for relevance in 2024 (e.g. we now have `docker compose` rather than `docker-compose`).

## Spinning Up Lightsail Server in AWS

This assumes you have an AWS account. If you don't, go and sign up now! Then log into the AWS Console, and click on _Services -> Amazon Lightsail_. Click the "Create instance" button as shown below:

import aws_lightsail_create_instance from './_assets/aws-lightsail-create-instance.png'

<Image src={aws_lightsail_create_instance} width="900px">The Amazon Lightsail homepage with the \"Create instance\" button.</Image>

Firstly, choose an "Instance Location". You can pick something close to where most of your users are, but in the end it doesn't matter much!

Then under "Select a blueprint", click "Operating System (OS) only". Select Ubuntu 22.04 as shown in below. You could choose a different Linux OS, like AWS Linux, but the commands will be different (e.g. you'll have to use `yum` instead of `apt`) and the nginx config files structure won't be setup to use `sites-available`/`sites-enabled` (slightly different ways of doing things).

import picking_ubuntu_22_04_in_lightsail from './_assets/picking-ubuntu-22-04-in-lightsail.png'

<Image src={picking_ubuntu_22_04_in_lightsail} width="800px">Picking Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the OS in Lightsail.</Image>

Then select or create a keypair to authenticate with this server. If creating a new keypair, the private key will be downloaded. Save this for later when we need to ssh into the instance to set it up.

<Aside type="caution">
Don't lose your private key, you can't re-download it from the Lightsail console!
</Aside>

Select the _Networking Type_. As of March 2024, Amazon is about to charge more for servers that have IPv4 addresses. IPv6 only should work fine -- except that IPv6 doesn't work for cloning projects of GitHub, nor some docker-based commands which fetch data from remotes. What we can do though is perform all of the setup with a public IPv4 address, and then once we are complete, create a Snapshot, and create a new instance from the Snapshot that is IPv6 only. So let's continue with an instance which has both an IPv4 and IPv6 address -- select `Dual stack` for the Networking Type as shown below.

Select a size. Umami does not take many resources to run. However I had issues with the memory capped at 512MB, so I picked the 1GB RAM/40GB SSD size (as of March 2024, US$5.00/month). Let me know if you get is running successfully on smaller resources!

import choosing_dual_stack_and_size_lightsail from './_assets/choosing-dual-stack-and-size-lightsail.png'

<Image src={choosing_dual_stack_and_size_lightsail} width="700px">Choosing the networking type and size of the Lightsail instance.</Image>

Choose an instance name to easily identify this Lightsail instance in the future, e.g. `Umami-Ubuntu-IPv4-1GB`. It's completely up to you and what you want to call it.

Click `Create Instance` and your server will be spun up!

## Add a Rule For Https

Once your Lightsail instance has spun up, click on the `Networking" tab under your Lightsail instance, and then add a IPv4 firewall rule allowing https traffic as shown below:

import ipv4_https_firewall_rule_in_lightsail from './_assets/ipv4-https-firewall-rule-in-lightsail.png'

<Image src={ipv4_https_firewall_rule_in_lightsail} width="700px">Adding a IPv4 firewall to allow https traffic in Lightsail.</Image>

This will come in useful later when we force traffic to use `https` only.

## Create a DNS A Record

Now you need to create a DNS A Record that points your subdomain `umami.my-domain.com` to the IP address of the Lightsail instance you just created.

I use Cloudflare, so the image below shows a screenshot of myself setting up the A record through the Cloudflare control panel. It should be similar with most other DNS providers.

import adding_dns_a_record_in_cloudflare from './_assets/adding-dns-a-record-in-cloudflare.png'

<Image src={adding_dns_a_record_in_cloudflare} width="900px">Adding a DNS A record to point to the IP address of the Lightsail instance.</Image>

## Installing Umami

**Connect via your Lightsail instance via ssh.** You can use the in-browser terminal if you want, but I much prefer a proper terminal-based session (e.g. from Windows Terminal, bash on Linux, e.t.c.) for better responsiveness and copy/paste support.

I had problems using the subdomain to connect, so **I just used the IP address directly**. The IP address is shown on the main page for the Lightsail instance. You will need the private key that you setup/selected when you created the Lightsail instance above, which you can pass in to `ssh` using the `-i` option:

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/private-key.pem ubuntu@34.207.322.232
```

`cd` into the `/opt` directory, this is where we will put the Umami source code:

```shell
cd /opt
```

Clone the Umami repo:

```shell
sudo git clone https://github.com/mikecao/umami.git
```

`cd` into the new directory:

```shell
cd umami/
```

We'll now edit the `docker-compose.yml` file, to make sure it only exposes the `3000` port on `localhost`, and not publicly (I'm not sure if it matters because the Lightsail firewall is a second line of defense here, but better to be on the cautious side):

```shell
sudo nano docker-compose.yml
```

Find the following section:

```yaml
ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

and add `127.0.0.1` to the front so that it now looks like:

```yaml
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
```

Save these changes and exit `nano`. We can't yet run Umami because we don't have Docker. Let's do that next!

## Install Docker

We'll need to install docker so we can actually run Umami. I grabbed these instructions from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/. Add Docker's `apt` repository:

```shell
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

And then install Docker:

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

## Start Umami on Localhost

Now that Docker is installed (along with the subcommand `docker compose`), we should be able to start the Umami application. Run the following command:

```shell
sudo docker compose up -d
```

You should see output similar to shown below:

import umami_docker_up_command_worked from './_assets/umami-docker-up-command-worked.png'

<Image src={umami_docker_up_command_worked} width="500px">Running \"sudo docker compose up -d\" and watching Docker pull the layers and start the database and application.</Image>

We can check that Umami is up and running with the following command:

```shell
curl localhost:3000
```

This will make a request to your localhost at port `3000`. If it's working, you should see something like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html id="__next_error__"><head><meta charSet="utf-8"/> ...
```

## Configure Umami to Start On Boot

You'll likely want to configure the docker command above to run on boot. That way, if your server ever restarts for any reason, your server will start up and run without manually having to ssh into the server and start it manually.

To do this, first create a new file in `/etc/init.d/` called `start-umami.sh` with the following contents:

```shell
docker compose -f /opt/umami/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Save the file, and then make it executable:

```shell
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/start-umami.sh
```

Now you can add this script to the list of services that start on boot:

```shell
sudo update-rc.d start-umami.sh defaults
```

All done! Test this out by restarting the server and checking that Umami is running after the restart.

## Install nginx

Whilst we could just expose the Umami `3000` port to the public and get basic `http` working, we are going to install nginx and place it between the public and our Umami application. This will allow us to add support for `https`.

Let's install nginx:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

Add a new config:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/umami.conf
```

```conf
server {
    listen       80;
    listen       [::]:80;
    server_name  umami.my-domain.com;

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/umami.access.log;
    error_log   /var/log/nginx/umami.error.log;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }
}
```

Now create a symbolic link in `sites-enabled` that points to the config file we just created in `sites-available`. This "enables" the configuration so that nginx will run it:

```shell
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/umami.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

<Aside type="tip">
If you chose a something other than Ubuntu to run Umami on, you might not have the `sites-enabled` and `site-available` directories. If this is you, search online on how to add nginx configuration for your particular OS (it's not tricky).
</Aside>

Now that we've modified the config file, reload nginx:

```shell
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Test http Access

You should now be able to get to your Umami server using `http` from anywhere on the internet! Let's test it out before we move onto switching to `https`. Type `http://umami.my-domain.com` into your browser. You should make it to the following screen.

import umami_login_screen from './_assets/umami-login-screen.png'

<Image src={umami_login_screen} width="900px">If you make it to this Umami login screen, your http setup is working.</Image>

Before continuing it's a good idea to log in to Umami and change your password, as your Umami server is now available to the public! The default username is `admin` and the default password is `umami`.

Now let's setup `https`.

## Install Certbot

Setting up `https` is made very easy by the `certbot` program and Let's Encrypt. Firstly, install `certbot` and the nginx plugin.

```shell
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Now run the following command to install certificates for your Umami instance. This will also modify the nginx configuration we created earlier to enable `https`, and to redirect all `http` traffic to `https`.

```shell
sudo certbot --nginx -d umami.my-domain.com
```

You'll be prompted to enter in an email address. Once it's complete, it should have modified your nginx `umami.conf` and restarted nginx so that you're set to go!

For reference, Certbot should have modified your `/etc/nginx/sites-available/umami.conf` so that it looks similar to the following:

```conf
server {
    server_name  umami.my-domain.com;

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/umami.access.log;
    error_log   /var/log/nginx/umami.error.log;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }

    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/umami.my-domain.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/umami.my-domain.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = umami.my-domain.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    listen       80;
    listen       [::]:80;
    server_name  umami.my-domain.com;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

It also makes it so `http` traffic is redirected to `https`. That is the second `server` section in the above `.conf` file (with the `listen 80` part).

Certbot will automatically renew the certificates before they expire.

## Test It Works With Https

That's it, you should now be able to use `https`! To test, type `https://umami.my-domain.com` into your browser, and you should be able to get to the same login screen that we got to previously.

## CloudFlare Adjustments

My Cloudflare account defaulted to the SSL/TLS encryption mode set to "Flexible". As soon as I ran the Let's Encrypt step above, I couldn't get access to Umami through `https` due to a "Too many redirects" error. To fix this, I had to go to the Cloudflare dashboard, click on `SSL/TLS` -> `Overview` and change the Encryption mode from "Flexible" to "Full (strict)" as shown below:

import change_ssl_settings_in_cloudflare_from_flexible_to_full_strict from './_assets/change-ssl-settings-in-cloudflare-from-flexible-to-full-strict.png'

<Image src={change_ssl_settings_in_cloudflare_from_flexible_to_full_strict} width="900px">Screenshot of me changing the SSL settings in CloudFlar from Flexible to Full (strict) so that https will work without getting the \"too many redirects\" error.</Image>

This might be very Cloudflare specific -- if you are using another DNS provider you might not have to change any setting similar to this.

## Migrate to IPv6 Only

I ran into problems trying to setup the server using IPv6 only, mostly due to GitHub not supporting IPv6 when cloning and some docker commands failing. However, once the server is setup using IPv4, you can migrate it to IPv6 by doing the following.

First, create a snapshot of the existing server in AWS Lightsail as shown below:

import create_snapshot_in_lightsail from './_assets/create-snapshot-in-lightsail.png'

<Image src={create_snapshot_in_lightsail} width="700px">Creating a snapshot of the Umami instance in preparation for moving to IPv6 only.</Image>

Once the snapshot has been created, you can click the three vertical ellipses next to it and click "Create new instance". From there, you will be able to select an IPv6 only setup. Note you can also change the instance size here, but you cannot choose a smaller size, presumably because you can't easily make disks smaller (even if you are not using all of the available space).

Now when you ssh into the server, the command will look something like this:

```shell
ssh -i my-private-key.pem ubuntu@2600:1f18:4f08:c400:f26a:6a5:e85c:2420
```

Create a AAAA record with your DNS provider that points your domain to the servers IPv6 address. Remove the existing A record that pointed to the IPv4 instance.

All done! You should now be able to get to the Umami dashboard by going to `umami.my-domain.com`.

I presume certbot certificate renewal will work just fine with this IPv6 server. I've yet to hit this point in time (`sudo certbot renew` does nothing until the certificates are about to expire).

## Sending Data to Umami

This page was all about how to setup the Umami server. But you might be wondering, what next? To send analytics data to Umami, you'll have to embed the client side script into the web pages you want to track.

To do this, follow the ["Add a website" tutorial on Umami](https://umami.is/docs/add-a-website). Once you have done that you should be able to login to the dashboard and see analytics like shown below:

<Image src={umami_dashboard_showing_analytics_for_blog} width="900px">The Umami dashboard showing the page views and visitor count for this blog.</Image>

## Fine Tuning The Umami Script

Another thing that is worth mentioning is that you probably want to disable the script when developing your site/web application locally. If you don't, you'll likely end up with many false hits being recorded in Umami. This is especially true with hot-reloading systems which refresh the page every time you save the source code.

import localhost_being_the_top_referrer_in_umami from './_assets/localhost-being-the-top-referrer-in-umami.png'

<Image src={localhost_being_the_top_referrer_in_umami} width="600px">Oh oh! Umami is running when developing, and clocking up many page visits.</Image>

How exactly you do this depends on what framework your site runs on/in. I'll give you a few examples which may be useful for your application. This blog uses Hugo, so I can use the following guard in my `baseof.html` file:

```html
{{ if eq (getenv "HUGO_ENV") "production" | or (eq .Site.Params.env "production")  }}
<script defer src="https://umami.mbedded.ninja/script.js" data-website-id="e0f4b55d-8cc8-4afe-ab25-68d695b46826"></script>
{{ end }}
```

[NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/) runs on React, so I used the following in my `index.tsx` file:

```js
if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.type = 'text/javascript';
  script.src = 'https://umami.mbedded.ninja/script.js';
  script.setAttribute('data-website-id', 'b0ab1a49-5d70-4e53-b2e2-6f3b8127ef84');
  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
} else {
  console.log('Detected dev. environment, not adding Umami script.');
}
```

Note that the NinjaTerm example above uses Javascript in inject the equivalent script tag into the head of the HTML document if the production environment variable evaluates to `true`.

UPDATE: The above way to only include the script if `import.meta.env.PROD` is true works great -- except if you start making Umami API calls to track things like events. If you need to do this, you'd have to guard every call with a check to make sure `window.umami` is defined, which can get repetitive and feels like bad design. The better approach is to always include the script in the `head`, but set `umami.disabled` to `1` in local storage in dev. environments[^umami-docs-track-events]. Umami does not send analytics in this case, but the API is still available.

Here is an example:

```js
// Enable Umami analytics script in production and disable
// in dev. environment. Use the umami.disabled key in local storage for doing so
if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
  // It's not good enough just to set the key to 0, it needs to be removed
  window.localStorage.removeItem('umami.disabled');
} else {
  console.log('Detected dev. environment, setting umami.disabled in local storage to "1".');
  window.localStorage.setItem('umami.disabled', '1');
}
```
