<Image src={react_logo} width="400px">The React logo.</Image>

## Injecting Variables At Build Time

React recognizes either environment variables or variables defined in a `.env` file located at the project root. React only recognizes variables which begin with `REACT_APP_`

```bash
export REACT_APP_SERVER_URL="www.myserver.com/api"
```

Environment variables take precedence over those defined in the `.env` file.

Imported variables are available in the React environment under `process.env`:

```js
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_URL)
// stdout: www.myserver.com/api
```
