## Overview

Use this page to **help you install Diligent JTAG drivers on your computer so you can use JTAG to the Xilinx Zynq-7000 ZC702 board via the micro-USB connection**. No special JTAG programmer is required, as the ZC702 development board has a USB-to-JTAG module on board.

This tutorial is designed for people running a Ubuntu client using VMware on a Windows host.

## Install Diligent JTAG Drivers On Windows

You will need the cable drivers on both Windows and Ubuntu (you need them on Windows so that you can do a USB pass through to the virtual machine). Download and install either Vivado Design Suite (large!) or Vivado Lab Edition (smaller install size) from [https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) on Windows. This should install the Diligent JTAG drivers.

Once the drivers have been installed on Windows, VMware detects the cable as "Future Devices Digilent Adept USB Device", under VM->Removable Devices. Connect this device to the virtual machine.

Plug the micro USB cable into the ZC702 dev. board and your computer.

<Aside type="note">
On recent versions of Mac OS (as of Aug 2017), it looks like the JTAG device on the ZC-702 is recognized as a "Digilent Adept USB Device" without the installation of any additional drivers.

## Install Diligent JTAG Drivers And SDK On Ubuntu

Download and install the SDK on Ubuntu (again, from [https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)). This includes the xsdb program, which is located

Now download and install _Vivado Design Suite_ or _Vivado Lab Edition_ on Ubuntu. Vivado includes the drivers for the JTAG cable, but unlike Windows, **they are NOT automatically installed on Linux**.

To install the drivers on Linux, once Vivado is installed (we assume it's been installed to /opt/Xilinx/), navigate to:

```sh    
/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2017.1/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers
```

And then run the install_drivers script (with admin privileges) that resides in this directory:

```sh    
gbmhunter@ubuntu:/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2017.1/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers$ sudo ./install_drivers
```
