## Overview

This page is a walk-through to show you how to add your own code/app to a custom Linux build that uses Yocto.

## Making A Basic Hello, World App (Binary)

Firstly, we need a basic application that we can then add to a Yocto build. Let's create a simple application that prints `Hello, World` to `stdout` and then exits.

We need to create the following files:

* HelloWorld.c
* HelloWorld.h
* LICENSE
* configure.ac
* Makefile.am

These will be added to a git repository and pushed to GitHub (no folder structure, all these files will be added to the root repository directory).

Let's create a `HelloWorld.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include "HelloWorld.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, World...\n");
    return 0;
}
```

And a matching `HelloWorld.h`:

```c    
#ifndef HELLO_WORLD_H
#define HELLO_WORLD_H

/* Some cross-platform definitions generated by autotools */
#if HAVE_CONFIG_H
#  include <config.h>
#endif /* HAVE_CONFIG_H */

#endif /* HELLO_WORLD_H */
```

We also need a `LICENSE` file. Yocto is quite particular about licenses, to ensure that users can specify exactly what licensing restrictions are present in a particular build (e.g. make sure this build ONLY contains open-source code). Create a `LICENSE` file, we will use the MIT license for this one:

```text
The MIT License (MIT)

```

We need a `configure.ac` file:

```text
#                                               -*- Autoconf -*-
# Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script.

#AC_PREREQ(2.60)
AC_INIT(YoctoHelloWorldApp, 1.0, gbmhunter@gmail.com)
AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([HelloWorld.c])
AC_CONFIG_HEADER([config.h])
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(YoctoHelloWorldApp, main)

# Checks for programs.
AC_PROG_CC
AC_PROG_INSTALL
AC_PROG_MAKE_SET

# Checks for libraries.
AM_PROG_LIBTOOL

# Set shared libraries
AC_DISABLE_STATIC
AC_ENABLE_SHARED

# Checks for header files.

# Checks for typedefs, structures, and compiler characteristics.

# Checks for library functions.

#AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
AC_OUTPUT
```

Finally, make a `Makefile.am`:

```text
AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = foreign

CFLAGS = -Wall -pedantic
include_HEADERS = HelloWorld.h

bin_PROGRAMS = helloworld
helloworld_SOURCES = HelloWorld.c
```

Notice in the `Makefile.am` file that we add `helloworld` to the `bin_PROGRAMS` variable. This makes Yocto create a binary executable of your example "Hello, World" application and places it in `/usr/bin`, making it executable from the command-line. We will use this feature to test it in QEMU once we have built the image below.

Commit all these files into a git repository. If you want the Yocto layer to download the files automatically, this repository needs to be placed on a server, so I used GitHub.

<Aside type="note">
During development, you may not want to have to commit everytime you wish to build your code. See the bottom of this page on how achieve this.
</Aside>

The code for this example app is located at [https://github.com/gbmhunter/YoctoHelloWorldApp](https://github.com/gbmhunter/YoctoHelloWorldApp).

## Make A Layer To Hold The App

The application needs to be added to a Yocto layer before it can be included in a build. It can either be added to an existing layer, or added to a new one. We will create a new layer to keep the development environment "clean". All layers are contained with a `meta-<layer name>` folder.

We will create a layer called `meta-example`. Create a new directory called meta-example in the main Yocto directory (called `poky` in our case).

```sh 
~/poky$ mkdir meta-example
```

Now `cd` into this new directory and create a new folder called `conf`.

```sh    
~/poky$ cd meta-example
~/poky/meta-example$ mkdir conf=
```

The config folder holds configuration data about the layer. `cd` into this directory and create a new file called `layer.conf`:

```sh    
~/poky/meta-example$ cd conf
~/poky/meta-example/conf$ touch layer.conf
```

Add the standard config code to `layer.conf` as shown below. This `layer.conf` file tells Yocto where the BitBake files are located in this package. We won't go into any more detail about this file, as this is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

```text
# We have a conf and classes directory, add to BBPATH 
BBPATH := "${BBPATH}:${LAYERDIR}" 
# We have a packages directory, add to BBFILES 
BBFILES := "${BBFILES} ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \ 
            ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend" 
BBFILE_COLLECTIONS += "example" 
BBFILE_PATTERN_example := "^${LAYERDIR}/" 
BBFILE_PRIORITY_example := "5"
```

We have finished with the `conf` folder. We now need to create a recipe for this layer of ours. `cd` into the parent directory, and create a new directory called `recipes-example`.

```sh    
~/poky/meta-example/conf$ cd ..
~/poky/meta-example$ mkdir recipes-example
```

Now `cd` into `recipes-example`, and create a new folder called `HelloWorld`:

```sh    
~/poky/meta-example$ cd recipes-example
~/poky/meta-example/recipes-example$ mkdir HelloWorld
```

This `HelloWorld` folder is going to contain a file which says that the HelloWorld app that we created above should be part of this recipe. `cd` into the `HelloWorld` directory, and create a new file called `HelloWorld_1.0.bb`:

```sh    
~/poky/meta-example/recipes-example$ cd HelloWorld
~/poky/meta-example/recipes-example/HelloWorld$ touch HelloWorld_1.0.bb
```

This `HelloWorld_1.0.bb` is a BitBake file which points to the location that the HelloWorld app is stored (in our case, GitHub). It contains the following code:

```text
#
# This file was derived from the 'Hello World!' example recipe in the
# Yocto Project Development Manual.
#

DESCRIPTION = "Example Hello, World application for Yocto build."
SECTION = "examples"
DEPENDS = ""
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://LICENSE;md5=96af5705d6f64a88e035781ef00e98a8"

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}-${PV}:"

SRCREV = "c96b1fdd0767a9a13b9fca9d91fd3975c44c9de4"
SRC_URI = "git://github.com/gbmhunter/YoctoHelloWorldApp.git"

S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

inherit autotools

# The autotools configuration I am basing this on seems to have a problem with a race condition when parallel make is enabled
PARALLEL_MAKE = ""
```

The first thing to note is `SRC_URL`. This points to where the HelloWorld application lives. Notice the `git://` at the start, this is slightly different to the URL you would use to push/pull using SSH or HTML.

Also note `SRCREV`. This points to the SHA of the commit you wish to use when building. Remember to update this if you push new commits to the repo!

Also note `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM`. This tells Yocto where the license file is in the HelloWorld repo, and what the MD5 checksum of that file is. Yocto checks to make sure this file exists and the checksum is still the same, to make sure the licensing hasn't changed.

If you want to calculate the MD5 checksum of your own `LICENSE` file, you can use the `md5sum` UNIX command:

```sh    
$ md5sum LICENSE
96af5705d6f64a88e035781ef00e98a8  LICENSE
```

Use the number, but ignore the filename which is printed afterwards!

The code for this example layer is located at [https://github.com/gbmhunter/YoctoMetaExample](https://github.com/gbmhunter/YoctoMetaExample).

## Adding The Layer To The Build

The final step is to add the newly created layer to your build. Layers are not automatically included in each build, the layers used is determined by the file at `poky/build/conf/bblayers.conf`.

The default `bblayers.conf` file might look something like this:

```text
# POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
POKY_BBLAYERS_CONF_VERSION = "2"

BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
BBFILES ?= ""

BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /home/username/temp/poky/meta \
    /home/username/temp/poky/meta-poky \
    /home/username/temp/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
    "
```

We want to add our new layer to the `BBLAYERS` variable as shown below:

```text
BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /home/username/temp/poky/meta \
    /home/username/temp/poky/meta-poky \
    /home/username/temp/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /home/username/temp/poky/meta-example \
    "
```

## Build Time

`cd` back to `~/poky/build/`. We can now start the build process by running:

```sh    
~/poky/build$ bitbake core-image-minimal
```

This should take a few hours to complete when running it the first time!

## Run Linux Build And Test Custom App

Now you have built a Linux image with your custom application added, lets run the Linux image in QEMU and test that the application is present and runs correctly.

Use the following command to start QEMU:

```sh    
~/poky/build$ runqemu qemux86
```

Login as root (no password needed). You should now be at the command prompt inside your Linux build. You can now make sure your "Hello, World" application is present by using the command:

```sh    
root@qemux86:~# helloworld
Hello, World...
root@qemux86:~#
```
All done! You have added your own custom app to a Yocto build!
