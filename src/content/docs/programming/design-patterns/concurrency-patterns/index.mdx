## Overview

This page focuses on concurrency patterns applicable to _embedded_ software, that is software running on anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to embedded Linux in either C or C++.

The terms thread 1 and thread 2 are used as imaginary threads that need to share data in the following examples. These threads are treated as persistent threads which each carry out sporadic, important tasks, rather than a master/worker thread arrangement.

## Message Queues

**Example**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
    
#include "ThreadSafeQueue.hpp"
    
using namespace mn::CppUtils;
    
struct Cmd {
    std::string name;
    std::shared_ptr<void> data;
};
    
// We require a thread-safe queue, which is not part of the standard!
// See https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppUtils/blob/master/include/CppUtils/ThreadSafeQueue.hpp
ThreadSafeQueue<Cmd> queue_;
    
void ThreadFn() {
    Cmd cmd;
    
    while(true) {
        queue_.Pop(cmd);
        std::cout << "Received command. cmd.name = " << cmd.name << std::endl;
        
        if(cmd.name == "CMD_1") {          
            auto data = std::static_pointer_cast<std::string>(cmd.data); // Cast back to exact data type
            std::cout << "Received data (as string) = \"" << *data << "\"" << std::endl;
        } else if(cmd.name == "CMD_2") {
            // Do stuff with cmd.data
        } else if(cmd.name == "QUIT") {
            // Break from infinite while loop, which will mean that
            // this function will return and then thread.join() will
            // return
            break;  
        } else
            throw std::runtime_error("Command name not recognized.");
    }
}
    
int main() {
    std::thread t(ThreadFn);
    
    auto data = std::shared_ptr<std::string>(new std::string("hello"));
    
    Cmd cmd;
    cmd.name = "CMD_1";
    cmd.data = std::static_pointer_cast<void>(data); // Cast away the exact data type
    queue_.Push(cmd);
    
    cmd.name = "QUIT";
    cmd.data = nullptr; // Some commands may not need data!
    queue_.Push(cmd);
    
    t.join();
}
```

**Pros/Cons**

* Easier to prove that deadlocks do not exist
* Thread 1 cannot easily get data back from thread 2, as the only way to communicate is through the message queues. Thread 1 would have send a message to thread 2 requesting data, and then thread 2 would have to send a message back to thread 1 with the data. This can break the "flow" of the code for thread 1.
* Difficulties in safely handling multiple "types" of data sent on the message queue. The example above creates the data on the heap, creates a shared pointer to it and then casts away the type to `std::shared_ptr<void>`. You then have to make sure the receiving thread casts back to the correct type depending on the message.

## Synchronization Objects

The most basic form of synchronization object is a mutex. When using C, popular operating systems such as FreeRTOS or Linux provide OS specific mutexes. If using C++ and have the standard library available, you can use `std::mutex` (as of C++11).

Why do we have to use synchronization objects? Because if more than one threads happens to write to the same memory at the same time, we run into problems.

**Pros/Cons**

* Enables thread 1 to call a standard public function belonging to thread 2, along with all the benefits that go along with this such as type-safe input arguments and return arguments.
* Threads still require some notification object to block on
* It is harder for thread 1 to tell thread 2 to do some "work". Whilst in a message queue system thread 1 can just thread 2 a "do work" message, 

## A Hybrid Approach

What if we used a message queue for the sending thread to tell the receiving thread to perform some work, and a synchronization object when sending thread just wants to access some data from receiving thread?

This is possible with the use of a message queue for incoming messages and a synchronization object to synchronize the receiving message loop with the data accesses.

## A Message Queue That Can Wait For Return Data

One way to solve the "no return data" issue with message queues is for the receiving thread to send a thread-safe data object along with the rest of the message data to the sending thread. When this message is processed in receiving thread, it calculates the return data and notifies the sending thread with the thread-safe data object.

This can be implemented in C++ by using `std::future` and `std::promise`. These are synchronization objects that allow data to be transmitted between threads. The below code shows an example of this. Note how the `main()` function can call `thread1.SetData()` and then block and wait for return data by calling `thread1.GetData()`. Both of these calls result in messages arriving in thread 1's message queue.
