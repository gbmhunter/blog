## Overview

AWS Fargate is a container execution service provided by AWS. AWS manages the complexity of running and scaling the underlying infrastructure (which happens to be AWS EC2 instances).

## Why Fargate?

The AWS Lambda service is another way you can run code in the cloud in a serverless manner. Choose lambda if:

* You don't need more than 500MB hard disk space
* You don't need more than 3GB of memory
* Your program can finish within 15 minutes
* Your program does not need heavy compute power

Choose AWS Fargate if:

* You need more than 500MB disk space (you are only limited to what EC2 can provide).
* You need more than 3GB of memory (you are only limited to what EC2 can provide).
* Your program might take more than 15 minutes to complete. There is no runtime limitations with AWS Fargate.
* Your program needs heavy compute power. Fargate provides you with all the CPU options that EC2 can offer.


## CloudFormation

[https://github.com/1Strategy/fargate-cloudformation-example/blob/master/fargate.yaml](https://github.com/1Strategy/fargate-cloudformation-example/blob/master/fargate.yaml) is a good example of setting up a Fargate service in CloudFormation.

## Hello, World Example

### Invoke Fargate Job

You can invoke Fargate jobs from within Python by using `boto3`:

```python
import boto3

client = boto3.client('ecs')
response = client.run_task(
cluster='fargatecluster', # name of the cluster
launchType = 'FARGATE',
taskDefinition='my-batch-job:1', # replace with your task definition name and revision
count = 1,
platformVersion='LATEST',
networkConfiguration={
      'awsvpcConfiguration': {
          'subnets': [
              'subnet-2ec3a94a', # replace with your public subnet or a private with NAT
              'subnet-413a9c6e' # Second is optional, but good idea to have two
          ],
          'assignPublicIp': 'DISABLED'
      }
  })
return str(response)
```
