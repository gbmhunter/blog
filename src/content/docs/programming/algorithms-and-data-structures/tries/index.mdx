<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The word trie comes from the word re<b>trie</b>val. A trie is also known as a <i>digital tree</i>, <i>radix tree</i> or <i>prefix tree</i>.</p>

<p>Each node contains the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>A value, which can be <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>An array of pointers to child nodes, where each one may optionally be <code>null</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A trie usually has an empty root node (or <code>""</code>). This root node contains a list of nodes, one for each character in the alphabet (e.g. 26 entries for English). The characters are mapped to pointers in the array by their index, were A = 0 and Z = 25.</p>

<p>The value is used to indicate whether or not the sequence of letters from the root node to the current node form a valid word (if they don't, they only exist because there is a larger word which contains these letters).</p>

<h2>Complexity</h2>

<p>The worst case time to construct a trie is dependent on the product of the longest word $ m $, and how many words the trie contains $n$. This is written using Big-O notation as $ \mathcal{O}(mn) $. The time it takes for insertion, deletion and searching is dependent on the product of the length of the word you are inserting, deleting or searching for $a$, and the total number of words $n$. This is expressed as $\mathcal{O}(an)$.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>Tries are used in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Search engines</li>
<li>Spell-checkers</li>
<li>Auto-complete</li>
</ul>
