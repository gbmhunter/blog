## Overview

A command-line interface is a way of interacting (sending instructions, receiving info) with programs on a computer.

<Aside type="note">
For a C++ command-line interpreter, that can run on both embedded and P.C. architectures, see [clide-cpp on Github](https://github.com/gbmhunter/clide-cpp).

See [C->Processing Command-Line Input](/programming/languages/c/processing-command-line-input) for how to write C code for dealing with command-line arguments passed to main().

## Command Description (Help) Syntax

* Angled brackets for required parameters, e.g. `cd <dir name>`.
* Square brackets for optional parameters, e.g. `ls [-a]`.
* Ellipses for repeated items, e.g. `cp <source1> [source2...]`.
* Vertical bars and curly braces when there is a choice of items (logical or), e.g. `netstat {-t|-u}`.
