## warning: ISO C++ says that these are ambiguous, even though the worst conversion for the first is better than the worst conversion for the second:

* Compilers: Clang
* Default Severity: Warning

This is a form of overload ambiguity. It occurs because a candidate function is only better than another candidate function if `NONE` of it's parameters are a worst match than the parameters of the other, and at least one conversion is better.

## error: undefined reference to `typeinfo for [classname]`

* Compilers: Clang
* Default Severity: Error

This can come about if you have run-time info disabled via the `-fno-rtti` GCC compiler option.

This can also come about from forgetting to declare non-pure virtual functions, as the following snippet from GCC suggests.

> If the class declares any non-inline, non-pure virtual functions, the first one is chosen as the “key method” for the class, and the `vtable` is only emitted in the translation unit where the key method is defined.

## no out-of-line virtual method definitions

```text
MyClass has no out-of-line virtual method definitions; its vtable will be emitted in every translation unit
```

* Compilers: Clang
* Default Severity: Warning

This warning is emitted by `Clang` whenever it can't find any virtual methods for a class outside of the class declaration. This condition typically arises when writing header-only classes. If you are writing a header-only class, you can safely ignore this warning, understanding that more code space will be consumed due to `vtable` duplication (which should be a big issue in most situations).

To silence this warning, you can add:

```c++
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wweak-vtables"

// Your code here

#pragma clang diagnostic pop
```
