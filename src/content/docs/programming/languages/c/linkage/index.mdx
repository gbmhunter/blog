## The extern Keyword

The `extern` keyword is a linkage modifier that has different meanings in different contexts. In C++, when used it the form `extern "C"`, it can be used to declare functions and variables which should have C linkage.

`extern` is not normally used in function definitions/declarations.

With variables, `extern` is normally used in-front of a variable declaration to declare that it is defined elsewhere (this will stop the compiler from trying to look for it, and save this for the linker step).

Inline functions have special rules on what the word `extern` means.
