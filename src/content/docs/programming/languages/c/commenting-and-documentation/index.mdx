## General Tips

* Always use `\\` style comments where possible. This allows you to use `/*` style comments for commenting out large blocks of code when debugging. If you want to comment a block of code which has `/*` comments inside it, you will run into problems! (unfortunately, `*/` style comments don't nest in c).
* However, sometimes you still need to comment out blocks of code which have `/*` comments already inside them (maybe your using someone elses code?). To do this, you can use the preprocessor trick `#if 0` (see code below).

```c    
// This is a single lined comment, and the preferred way of doing things

/* This is
a multilined
comment.
And should be used sparingly as these don't nest */

// The following example shows how you can comment out code blocks
// containing "/*" comments using the pre-processor and "#if 0"
#if 0
void test1()
{
    /* Annoying multi-line
    comment in a block
    of code you want to comment */
}
#endif // #if 0
```

## C Supports URL's, Wait What?

Did you know that:

```c    
http://www.google.com
```

is valid syntax in C? Wait, what? O.K., I was lying, C doesn't support URLs, but the syntax is still valid! What it actually represents is a label (`http:`), followed by a single-line comment (`//www.google.com`).

## Commenting Styles

Some people put function descriptions after the function name and parameters, and before the opening curly brace (for example, some windows driver files). I find this method weird and hard to read.

```c    
NTSTATUS
DriverEntry(
    IN PDRIVER_OBJECT  DriverObject,
    IN PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath
    )
/*++

Routine Description:

    Installable driver initialization entry point.
    This entry point is called directly by the I/O system.

Arguments:

    DriverObject - pointer to the driver object

    RegistryPath - pointer to a unicode string representing the path,
                    to driver-specific key in the registry.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS if successful,
    STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL otherwise.

--*/
{
    WDF_DRIVER_CONFIG               config;
    NTSTATUS                        status;

    rest of function code...
```

## Doxygen

Doxygen is a powerful documentation generator that can be used with the C language. For more information and code examples with Doxygen, go to the [Doxygen page](/programming/general/doxygen).
