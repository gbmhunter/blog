The standard C library provides functions for writing input and output to files.

Most of the file input/output functions are declared in header stdio.h. Add the line `#include <stdio.h>` to your source code to use file I/O functions.

## fopen()

`fopen()` is used to open a file.

The function declaration changed in C99, by adding the keyword restrict. Before C99 it was:

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);
```

In C99 and above:

```c 
FILE *fopen(const char *restrict filename, const char *restrict mode);
```

where:

```
filename: Null-terminated string of the filename to associate the data to
mode: Null-terminated string that determines the file access mode
```

`fopen()` returns pointer to opened file stream on success, otherwise a `NULL` pointer on fail.

You have to be careful when using `fopen()` on a system with multiple threads, there is the possibility of creating race conditions.
