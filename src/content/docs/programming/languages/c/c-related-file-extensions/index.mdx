## Overview

The following table lists the standard file extensions used for C-related files. The extension normally indicates how far the file is through the compilation process. Note that many integrated development environments (IDEs), and command-line compilers hide most of the individual compiler steps from the user.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File Extension</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>file-name.c</code></td>
      <td>C source code which must be preprocessed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>file-name.i</code></td>
      <td>C source code which should not be preprocessed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>file-name.h</code></td>
      <td>C header file (not to be compiled or linked).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>file-name.s</code></td>
      <td>Assembler code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr >
      <td><code>file-name.S</code></td>
      <td>Assembler code which must be preprocessed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>file-name.o</code></td>
      <td>Object file by default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the extension .c, .i, .s etc with .o. This can be changed with a command line parameter.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>file-name</code></td>
      <td>If the file has no extension, this is usually the final executable (NIX systems).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>file-name.exe, .dll, .com</code></td>
      <td>The final executable on a Windows system.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
