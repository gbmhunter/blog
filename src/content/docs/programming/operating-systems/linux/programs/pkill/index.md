## Overview

`pkill` is a program that can be used to send a signal to a processes, by specifying a regex pattern that matches part of the process name (or it's full command line name with the `-f` option).

## Force Kill

The most direct way to kill a process is with:

```sh   
$ sudo pkill -9 "this_matches_part_of_process_name"
```

The `-9` option tells `pkill` to issue the `SIGKILL` signal.

## Be Careful!

pkill can be the nuclear bomb of all kill tools, as it is surprisingly easy to make the pattern too weak, and it matches something you didn't intend. And a way to crash your computer:

```sh   
$ sudo pkill -9 ".*" 
```
