## Overview

PIC18 is a family of microcontrollers from Microchip. This includes the PIC18C and PIC18F sub-families.

## Compilers

The newest compiler for the PIC18 family of microcontrollers (as of July 2016) is the Microchip XC8 compiler. More information an be found on the [MPLAB XC Compilers page](/programming/compilers/mplab-xc-compilers).

## EEPROM

The old-style (now deprecated) way of reading and writing to EEPROM was to use the following macros (defined in `pic18.h`):

```c
EEPROM_READ(addr)
EEPROM_WRITE(addr, value)
```

Note that these are now depreciated and if using MPLAB X, these macros get turned into empty shells which don't actually do anything (well, unless `#if _EEPROMSIZE > 0 && defined(_PLIB)` is true, which it is not by default). and they don't raise any compiler warnings/errors, meaning your EEPROM may not work and you don't know about it!).

What you can do is forgo the nice API and use direct manipulation instead. I have written the following two functions which read/write to EEPROM using register manipulation, and provide similar functionality to what the deprecated API did:

```c
//! @brief      Reads a single byte of data from the EEPROM.
//! @param      address     The EEPROM address to write the data to (note that not all
//!                         16-bits of this variable may be supported).
//! @returns    The byte of data read from EEPROM.
//! @warning    This function does not return until read operation is complete.
uint8_t Eeprom_ReadByte(uint16_t address) {

    // Set address registers
    EEADRH = (uint8_t)(address >> 8);
    EEADR = (uint8_t)address;

    EECON1bits.EEPGD = 0;       // Select EEPROM Data Memory
    EECON1bits.CFGS = 0;        // Access flash/EEPROM NOT config. registers
    EECON1bits.RD = 1;          // Start a read cycle

    // A read should only take one cycle, and then the hardware will clear
    // the RD bit
    while(EECON1bits.RD == 1);

    return EEDATA;              // Return data

}

//! @brief      Writes a single byte of data to the EEPROM.
//! @param      address     The EEPROM address to write the data to (note that not all
//!                         16-bits of this variable may be supported).
//! @param      data        The data to write to EEPROM.
//! @warning    This function does not return until write operation is complete.
void Eeprom_WriteByte(uint16_t address, uint8_t data) {
    // Set address registers
    EEADRH = (uint8_t)(address >> 8);
    EEADR = (uint8_t)address;

    EEDATA = data;          // Write data we want to write to SFR
    EECON1bits.EEPGD = 0;   // Select EEPROM data memory
    EECON1bits.CFGS = 0;    // Access flash/EEPROM NOT config. registers
    EECON1bits.WREN = 1;    // Enable writing of EEPROM (this is disabled again after the write completes)

    // The next three lines of code perform the required operations to
    // initiate a EEPROM write
    EECON2 = 0x55;          // Part of required sequence for write to internal EEPROM
    EECON2 = 0xAA;          // Part of required sequence for write to internal EEPROM
    EECON1bits.WR = 1;      // Part of required sequence for write to internal EEPROM

    // Loop until write operation is complete
    while(PIR2bits.EEIF == 0)
    {
        continue;   // Do nothing, are just waiting
    }

    PIR2bits.EEIF = 0;      //Clearing EEIF bit (this MUST be cleared in software after each write)
    EECON1bits.WREN = 0;    // Disable write (for safety, it is re-enabled next time a EEPROM write is performed)
}
```

## Writing Default Data To EEPROM On Program

Default data can be written to the EEPROM when programming the PIC18 microcontroller by using the `__EEPROM_DATA()` macro.

This macro takes 8 single-bye arguments, which writes 8 bytes of EEPROM data at once. This macro starts writing from address 0x0000 and auto-increments by 0x8 on every call.

## GPIO

The TRISx registers (where x  is the port letter, e.g. `TRISA`, `TRISB`) control the direction of the GPIO pins on that port. They can either be set as inputs or outputs.

## SPI

The SPI peripheral is controlled by the `SSPCON` and `SSPSTAT` registers. Note that these registers are also used to configure the I2C peripheral (the SPI and I2C cannot peripherals cannot be used at the same time).

Data is read/written to the SPI bus using the `SSPBUF` register.
