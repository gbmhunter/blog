## Overview

The 32-bit AURIX TriCore is a microcontroller family by Infineon with a focus on embedded safety and security features aimed towards the automotive and industrial markets. The name _TriCore_ refers to the fact that it combines elements of a RISC processor core, microcontroller and DSP in one design[^infineon-32-bit-aurix-tricore-microcontroller].

Clock speeds range from 133MHz to 300MHz[^infineon-32-bit-aurix-tricore-microcontroller]. The number of cores ranges from 1 to 6 and the number of lockstep cores from 0 to 4. Given the automotive emphasis, the MCUs typically have a large number of CAN peripherals (e.g. 2 to 6).

The TC2xx and TC3xx families seem to be the most popular.

As of March 2024, some of the lower end MCUs in this family cost around US$30 in quantities of 250.
