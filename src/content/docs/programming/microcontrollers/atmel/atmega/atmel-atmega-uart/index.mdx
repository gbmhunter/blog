I wrote some code to deal with communication through USART between two micro-controllers. The comms code has message identification, variable data length capability and does not need to use any interrupts. It is designed to be used with the USART module on the ATmega8 but it could be changed to use any communication protocol on any Atmega platform quite easily. The USART code is included with the comms code just to be helpful :-).
