## Overview

The AT32UC3 series of microcontrollers come with a pre-loaded USB bootloader. This allows you to program the devices through a USB connection with a computer without the need for an ISP or JTAG programmer.

This tutorial explains how to re-program, and/or modify the AT32UC3 bootloader. Atmel does not make this an easy task. Think again if you thought you could do it with a few clicks from within Atmel Studio 6. The documentation is sparse, the downloads (yes it requires many different programs) scattered around the back corners of their website, it involves many command-line operations, and the process filled with little gotchas and workarounds. Anyway, always look on the bright side of life? Right? Let us continue...

## Choose An Operating System To Work Within

I choose Linux because command-line utilities such as make are more at home within Linux than Windows.

## Getting The Source Code

The first thing to do is get the bootloader source code. This is contained within the AVR UC3 Software Framework (currently at v1.7.0). This can be found at [https://code.google.com/p/goddac/downloads/detail?name=AVR-UC3-SoftwareFramework-1.7.0.zip](https://code.google.com/p/goddac/downloads/detail?name=AVR-UC3-SoftwareFramework-1.7.0.zip). Since we will be modifying files in this project, unzip it in your home directory.

```sh
$ unzip AVR-UC3-SoftwareFramework-1.7.0.zip
```

This should put all the files into a directory called `1.7.0-ATUC3`. Sweet! Now you can find the bootloader source code at `1.7.0-AT32UC3/SERVICES/USB/CLASS/DFU/EXAMPLES/ISP`. In this directory you should find the source code and associated headers (`isp.c/h`, `usb_dfu.c/h`). There are also sub-directories containing files specific to the different sub-families of the `AT32UC3` (e.g. `AT32UC3A`, `AT32UC3A3`, `AT32UC3B`, ...).

At this point I will pick a particular sub-family for the rest of the tutorial, the `AT32UC3A`. Obviously, replace all occurrences of this name with your particular sub-family. If you navigate into the `AT32UC3A` sub-folder, you will find an `IAR` and a `GCC` folder. Since we are using Linux, and the license for `GCC` does not cost any money, we will choose `GCC`. Go into the `GCC`
 folder.

Your path should now be:

```
1.7.0-AT32UC3/SERVICES/USB/CLASS/DFU/EXAMPLES/ISP/AT32UC3A/GCC
```

If you just run make, you get the error:

```text
*** multiple target patterns. Stop.
```

So, it turns out someone at Atmel forgot to do a `make clean` before zipping up the project. The folder structure has residual `.d` files from a previous build step. These `.d` files contain Windows style paths. The Makefile is trying to parse these `.d` files and this is what is causing the multiple target patterns error. So you need to deleting all of the `.d` files to fix this.

## Downloading The Toolchain

**Linux**

Install AVR Toolchain for Linux from [http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforlinux.aspx](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforlinux.aspx) .(Windows versions can be found at [http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforwindows.aspx](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforwindows.aspx)). Note you have to install both the source code (.tar.gz file) and the headers (.zip file) to `/opt`:

```sh
$ sudo tar xzf avr-32-gnu-tool-chain-linux_x86_64
```

and

```sh  
$ sudo unzip atmel-headers-6.1.3.1475.zip
```

Add `/opt/avr32-gnu-toolchain-linux_x86_64/bin` to the `PATH` variable.

You will then get an error similar to:  

```
../../BOOT/boot.S:47:22: error: avr32/io.h: No such file or directory  
```

Add `/opt/atmel-headers-6.1.3.1475/` to the end of the `INC_PATH` variable in the `config.mk` file to fix this

Then run make and it should actually work! But...it is probably not configured for your exact microcontroller.

## Tweaking config.mk

As previously mentioned, the file . The default is:

## Part: &#123none|ap7xxx|uc3xxxxx&#125

```
PART = uc3a0512
```

You will need to change this to suit your exact microcontroller. For example, I changed it too:

```
PART = uc3a3256
```

You will also have to change the board.

## Building

Run the command `make`.

Ohoh, the size of the `.bin` file is more than 8kB! I believe this is because Atmel used the IAR compiler, which results in slightly less code than the GCC compiler, even with the `-Os` optimisation flag set (this is set by default in `config.mk`). The pre-compiled bootloader binary that Atmel provides for the AT32UC3A3 microcontroller family (`at32uc3a3-isp-1.0.3.bin`) clocks in at a tidy 7,617B. 

## Modifying The Bootloader Size

In `conf_isp.h`, you'll want to change:

```c
#define PROGRAM_START_OFFSET          0x00002000
```

to

```c
#define PROGRAM_START_OFFSET          0x00004000
```

## Post-Build Programming

Now for post-build steps...

Need to change permissions of `post-build.sh` file.

```sh
$ sudo chmod +x post-build.sh
```

Run it. You should get the error: `cannot find avr32program`. To fix this, download the linux version of AVR32 Studio v2.6 (it must be v2.6, v2.5 does not have the available tools) from  
[http://www.atmel.com/tools/Archive/AVR32STUDIO2_6.aspx](http://www.atmel.com/tools/Archive/AVR32STUDIO2_6.aspx) to /opt/. Unzip with   
unzip avr32studio-ide-2.6.0.753-linux-gtk.x86_64.zip. This will unzip all the files into a directory called as4e-ide.

`avr32program` should be found at `as4e-ide/plugins/com.atmel.avr.utilities.linux.x86_64_3.0.0.201009140848/os/linux/x86_64/bin`. This needs to be added to your path.

But wait, what about `atprogram`, the newer replacement for `avr32program`, can we use that? Yes. And this would be the way I recommend. The commands to program the bootloader are:

```sh
atprogram -t jtagice3 -i jtag -d at32uc3a3256 chiperase

atprogram -t jtagice3 -i jtag -d at32uc3a3256 write -o 0x808001FC --values 0x929E2A9E

atprogram -t jtagice3 -i jtag -d at32uc3a3256 program -o 0x80000000 -f at32uc3a3-isp.bin --verify write -fs -o 0xFFFE1410 --values FFF7FFFF
```

This was designed for the JTAG ICE 3 and the `AT32UC3A3256`. Change these accordingly.
