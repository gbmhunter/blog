title: Image Captions Gone On NextGEN Update
type: post
---

import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

Grrrr...I updated the NextGEN gallery plugin, and it wiped all of my code that created a nice border and caption around images that where supplied with the parameter template=caption in the short code (see the post [NextGEN Template Code Gives Images A Caption And Fresh Look](/blog/2013/05-02-nextgen-template-code-gives-images-a-caption-and-fresh-look/index.mdx) for more info).

The border made the images look nicer, and the caption was very helpful at explaining what the image is all about!

Hopefully I can replace this code rather easily. I have regular backups which I save in Google Drive, and I wrote down the code changes I made on the page [Wordpress Plugins That This Site Uses](/programming/website-design/content-management-systems/wordpress/wordpress-plugins-that-this-site-uses/).

Expect to see the captions back soon!
