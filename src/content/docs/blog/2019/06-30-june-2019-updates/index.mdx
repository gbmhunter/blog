import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

The page on [Electrical Noise](/electronics/circuit-design/electrical-noise) moved from Electronics->Test And Measurement to Electronics->Circuit Design.

Renamed the Fast Fourier Transform page to the [Fourier Transform page](/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms), as it now contains information about other Fourier transforms.

Added graphs of 1D Fourier transformations:

import img_1d_fourier_transform from './_assets/1d-fourier-transform.png'

<Image src={img_1d_fourier_transform} width="400px"></Image>

and animated .gifs of 2D Fourier transformations:

import sinusoidal from './_assets/sinusoidal.gif'

<Image src={sinusoidal} width="400px"></Image>

Updated the pytest page with info on `mark` (markers) and `pytest` naming conventions.

Removed the `updates` directory that all monthly update posts were under.

Added a [tutorial on pandas](/programming/languages/python/pandas), a popular data analytics library for Python.

import pandas_logo from './_assets/pandas_logo.png'

<Image src={pandas_logo} width="700px">The pandas logo.</Image>

Updated the [Python Debugging page](/programming/languages/python/python-debugging) with more info on `pdb`.

Updated the [Filters page](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters) with more information on low-pass RC filters, including plots of the frequency response:

import rc_low_pass_filter_frequency_response from './_assets/rc-low-pass-filter-frequency-response.png'

<Image src={rc_low_pass_filter_frequency_response} width="500px"></Image>

I created a public mbedded.ninja project on CircuitMaker at [https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/GeoffreyHunter/mbedded-ninja](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/GeoffreyHunter/mbedded-ninja). I am going to trial out CircuitMaker as a tool for drawing schematic diagrams for this blog. In the past I have used Altium (not free), MultisimLive and InkScape (free but is a general vector graphics editor, not a dedicated electronics CAD program).

Added the [Command-Line CSV Viewer page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/command-line-csv-viewer), which contains information on how to cleanly view CSV files from the Linux command-line.

Added a [new page about the programming language Julia](/programming/languages/julia).

import julia_programming_language_logo from './_assets/julia_programming_language_logo.png'

<Image src={julia_programming_language_logo} width="200px">The Julia logo.</Image>
