import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

* Merged the Oscillators and Crystal pages (which were grouped under a section called _Timing_) into the single Oscillators page.

* Added information on [MEMS Oscillators](/electronics/components/oscillators/#mems-oscillators) and [Chip Package](/pcb-design/component-packages/chip-eia-component-packages) pages.

* Added info on [components that don't like ultrasonic baths](/electronics/tools/#ultrasonic-cleaners).

* Added a new page on [Common-mode Chokes](/electronics/components/common-mode-chokes).
