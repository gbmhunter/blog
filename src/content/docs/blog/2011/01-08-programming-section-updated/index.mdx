The Programming section of this site has been updated with comms code for communication between two microcontrollers. This was developed for the electric skateboard project but is totally generic and can be used for any project using two ATmegas that need to communicate with each other. Rather proud of this C module. Free to download!  Also check out the [Electric Skateboard Updates](/electronics/projects/electric-skateboard/electric-skateboard-updates).
