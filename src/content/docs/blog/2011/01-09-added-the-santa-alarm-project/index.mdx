import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

Added the [Santa Alarm](/electronics/projects/santa-alarm) project! My solution to early mornings...

import santa_alarm_09 from './santa_alarm_09.jpg'

Also, I added more information on interrupts in C. Not that exciting I know, but useful!
