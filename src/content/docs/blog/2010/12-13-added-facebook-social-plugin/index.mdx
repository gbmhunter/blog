import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

Added facebook social plug-ins to the DJing section and to this main page. The DJ one works well, however this one is in the wrong place, has the wrong colour, and doesn't look to great. Will fix at some point.
