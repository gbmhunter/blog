import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

Added the posts from the Kaboom website (the first rendition of this website, created back in 2004, which happened to still be active). Some of the links from the posts don't work as the material has been either deleted or lost through the years. But most of the content remains, mostly in the pyrotechnics section. You can still visit the site [here](http://homepages.inspire.net.nz/~hunter/kaboom/kaboom.htm).
