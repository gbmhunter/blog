import { Aside, CircuitJs, Image, WarningIsNotes } from '/src/components/General.astro';

So progress has been a little slower than usual lately, here are all the updates from Feburary 2014 to June 2014:

* New info on jumpers (jumpers in resistor packages) on the Resistors page

* New page on [electropermanent magnets](/electronics/components/electropermanent-magnets-epms) (cool electronic magnets which retain their magnetic state after powerdown.

* New force equation on the Capacitors page (related to the force exerted on the plates due to the electric charge)

* Picture added of card-edge connector gold fingers on the connectors page

* New component packages added to the popular [Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/).

* New page on [electrical comparators](/electronics/components/comparators).
		
* I am now using Latex to draw diagrams! I have begun using [QuickLatex](http://quicklatex.com/), [TikZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/) and [Circuitikz](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/circuitikz). This allows me to draw images like this:


import example_of_an_op_amp_circuit_drawn_with_circuitikz from './example-of-an-op-amp-circuit-drawn-with-circuitikz.png'

<Image src={example_of_an_op_amp_circuit_drawn_with_circuitikz} width="600px">An op-amp circuit drawn with Circuitikz/Latex.</Image>

    Admittedly, this is just an image, but the real diagrams on the [Op-Amp page](/electronics/components/op-amps) are described in the Tex language, and only rendered when you visit the page!

* And on a similar note, there is now both a [TikZ and PGF tutorial](/programming/languages/tex/tikz-and-pgf-tutorial) and a [CircuitikZ tutorial](/programming/languages/tex/drawing-schematics-with-tikz-and-circuitikz)
