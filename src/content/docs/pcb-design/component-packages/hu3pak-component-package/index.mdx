## Overview

The HU3PAK component package is a package design used solely by ST Microelectronics. It has 7 leads plus a tab (which has two PCB contact points). It has a pitch of 1.27mm[^bib-st-micro-hu3pak-package-mounting]. It's designed attached to a heatsink on it's top surface, but unusually does not have any provision for thermally coupling to the PCB (the recommended footprint only has a small amount of soldering points for the 7 pins and two tab locations).

The only use I could find for this package is for MOSFETs[^bib-st-micro-sthu32n65dm6ag-ds].

## Dimensions

The HU3PACK is 14mm wide, 18.58 long (including leads) and 3.50mm high[^bib-st-micro-hu3pak-package-mounting].

## Thermal Resistance

* $R_{JC} = 0.51^{\circ}C/W$[^bib-st-micro-sthu32n65dm6ag-ds]
* $R_{JA} = 30^{\circ}C/W$[^bib-st-micro-sthu32n65dm6ag-ds] (when mounted on 2oz. 1inch^2 PCB) (note that this thermal resistance hides the fact that the thermal resistance to ambient can be much lower if a top-side heatsink is added as intended)
