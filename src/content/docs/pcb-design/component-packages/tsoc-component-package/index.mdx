## Overview

TSOC (Thin Small-Outline C-Lead) is a SMD component package.

As far as I can tell, this package only comes in the 6-pin version (TSOC-6), and is only used by Dallas/Maxim (since 2001, Dallas has been a subsidiary of Maxim). While Maxim Integrated lists four different variants (see the `Title` section of the recommended land patterns below), there seems to be no physical difference between the D6+1 and D6-1 variants, and no difference between the D6N+1 and D6N-1 variants. The difference between the variants with and without `N` in their name are the package width and the lead length (and hence two slightly different land patterns).

Variants:

* D6+1/D6-1 (Variant A)
* D6N+1/D6N-1 (Variant B)

See [https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/packaging/package-information.html](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/packaging/package-information.html) for the official dimensions and land patterns from Maxim Integrated.
