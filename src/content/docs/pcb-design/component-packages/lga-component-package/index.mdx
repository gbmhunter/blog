## Overview

The `LGA` package is is a surface mount package with pads on the underside of the package. It is very similar to the [BGA package](/pcb-design/component-packages/bga-component-package/), except is does not have any balls, instead plain flat pads are used. An `LGA` package may also differ from `BGA` with the addition of arbitrary sized pads for purposes such as grounding, thermal dissipation, shielding and mechanical strength. An LGA package can be made from a PCB, thus many LGA components are actually entire "modules" made from a PCB and a number of components. This modular form is commonly seen with cellular modem and WiFi components.

CPU Variants:

| Code     | Socket Name
|----------|----------------
| LGA 771  | Intel Socket J
| LGA 775  | Intel Socket T
| LGA 1150 | Intel Socket H3
| LGA 1155 | Intel Socket H2
| LGA 1156 | Intel Socket H
| LGA 1207 | AMD Socket F, AMD Socket C32
| LGA 1356 | Intel Socket B2
| LGA 1366 | Intel Socket B
| LGA 1944 | AMD Socket G34
| LGA 2011 | Intel Socket R

The LGA package comes in many different variants, all which have a different number of pins and a different pin configuration. The pins are normally lines up in a grid of x columns and y rows, but not every position may have a pad. Therefore you can get variants with the same LGA package width and length.

Cannot solder with a soldering iron, soldering with hot air or infrared is o.k., recommended practise is to use reflow techniques.

Like BGAs, LGA packages can withstand up to 50% mis-alignment when soldering (50% of the distance between consecutive pads, i.e. it's pitch), as the package will automatically align itself[^bib-nxp-lga-rework]. LGA packages can be connected to the PCB either with a socket or direct soldering. Intel has popularised the package by using it on some of it's CPU families.

## Shifted Solder Mask Layouts

Sometimes LGA components recommend unique paste mask designs with "shifted" openings, as shown below.

## Common Uses

* CPUs
* Cellular modems
* WiFi modules

## Similar To

* [BGA](/pcb-design/component-packages/bga-component-package/): A BGA has balls on the underside pads, while a LGA doesn't.
* PGA
