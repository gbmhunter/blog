## Overview

SOT-1226-2 (Small Outline Transistor 1226) is a SMD component package. It has 8 leads with a pitch of 0.5mm.

A unique feature of this package is the diamond-shaped pads.

As of March 2015, NXP seems to be the only manufacturer using this package with the synonym X2SON5. NXP has a series of logic gates and line drivers in this package.
