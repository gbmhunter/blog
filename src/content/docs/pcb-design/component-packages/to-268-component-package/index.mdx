The TO-268 (Transistor Outline 268, commonly known as D3PAK) is a SMD component package. It is the third in the series of "DPAK" packages, the first being [TO-252 (DPAK)](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-252-component-package/) and the second being [TO-263 (D2PAK)](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-263-component-package/). The D3PAK name stands for "decawatt 3 package" and has the highest power dissipation rating out of the three. Unlike the TO-263 package, the TO-268 package only comes in one variant with 3 pins (as far as I can tell). This variant can be referred to as TO-268-3.

It is designed to have a really low thermal resistance so that it can be used in high power applications. The larger die also means that MOSFETs in this package can have lower $R_{DS(ON)}$ values, resulting in less power dissipation for the same current.

I have only ever seen this in the 3-pin variant (called TO-268-3). Common uses include Microsemi power MOSFETs, Microsemi power diodes, and Microsemi power IGBTs.

## Thermal Resistances

* $T_{JC}: 0.24-1.18^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$
* $T_{JA}: 40^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$
* $T_{JA}: 21.9^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (13.5x17.5mm copper pad)
* $T_{JA}: 18^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (19x29.4mm copper pad)

## Solderability

Easy to solder by hand, as long as you have a decent powered soldering iron for the central thermal pad. Easy to solder with infrared and reflow techniques.

## Recommended Land Pattern
