## Overview

`SOT-23` (_Small Outline Transistor 23_) is the JEDEC code for a family of very popular medium-sized SMD packages with 3 to 8 gull-wing leads.

When surface mount components were just beginning to gain popularity, `SOT-23` was introduced to replace the well used through-hole 3-pin [TO-18](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-18-component-package/) and [TO-92](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-92-component-package/) transistor packages, and so the first variant of `SOT-23` was the 3 leaded version (`SOT-23-3`, officially called `TO-236AA` by JEDEC)[^mad-pcb-sot-23].

The SOT-23 family probably has the largest number of differing variant names which all refer to the same packages (see the synonym section above).

The number of pins used not only depends on the required number of connections but also the desired thermal resistance (high-current `SOT-23` devices may use more than one pin for the same net to improve thermal performance). SparkFun makes a [SOT-23 to DIP breakout board](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/717).

The 3, 5, and 6 pin `SOT-23` variants have the same pitch of 0.95mm, and all are compatible with the 6 pin footprint (which means you can use a `SOT-23-6` adapter board for the 3 and 5 pin variants also). `SOT-23-8` has a smaller pitch to fit all the leads on the package.

JEDEC formalized the dimensions of the `SOT-23` package (and all it's variants) in the MO-178 document (with package designator `R-PDSO-G`). After registering, you can download this document for free from (https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/mo-178-c)[https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/mo-178-c].

The [SOT-23F package](../sot-23f-component-package/) is closely related to the `SOT-23` put has flat leads instead of gull-wing leads.

The body of all `SOT-23-x` packages is 1.30x2.92mm. The component area taking into account the leads is 7.98mm² (2.9x2.75mm). The standard land area is 11.22mm² (3.3x3.4mm).

Easy to hand-solder if you have had a bit of practise with surface mount devices before. Easy to solder with infrared or reflow techniques.

`R-PDSO-G` is the JEDEC package designator for SOT-23 in all it's variants[^jedec-mo-178-c].

## SOT-23-3

`SOT-23-3` is the most common package in the `SOT-23` family, and is sometimes just referred to as `SOT-23`. The image below shows a 3D render of the SOT-23-3 package by Nisshinbo.

* `SOT-346`: Some manufacturers consider the `SOT-23-3` and `SOT-346` to be different packages, and others conflate the two. I've decided to bundle them together, because after sifting through dimensions on many datasheet they generally have overlapping and very similar numbers, making them equivalent for most use cases. But I must stress, always check the datasheet!

Both `TO-236AA` and `TO-236AB` are official JEDEC names for the `SOT-23-3` package. An image comment on Wikipedia[^wikipedia-inductiveload] states that the `TO-236AB` package is approximately 0.1mm higher. However it is hard to verify this claim by comparing manufacturer package dimensions, as 0.1mm is well with the manufacturing tolerances.

### Dimensions

* Pitch: 1.9mm
* Body: 1.3mm wide, 2.9mm long, 1.0mm high
* Body + Leads: 2.5mm wide, 2.9mm long

### Common Uses

Because of the 3 leads, `SOT-23-3` is used for a large number of low-power 2-3 lead devices such as linear regulators, BJTs, MOSFETs and diodes (sometimes with two diodes, sharing either a common anode or cathode). 

* Linear regulators
* BJTs
* MOSFETs
* Diodes (including diode arrays)

### Similar To

The `SOT-23-3` package is very similar to the [SOT-346 package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-346-component-package/), with many manufacturer's dimensions for the two packages coinciding, and in many cases the same PCB land pattern will work with both packages.

### Non-standard Pin Numbering

<Aside type="caution">
The `SOT-23-6` package by Rohm (a.k.a `IMT4`, `SOT-457`, `SMT6`) has non-standard, clockwise pin numbering starting at the top right pin.

### Dimensions

The `SOT-23-6` has a pitch of 0.95mm. 

## SOT-23-8

### Synonyms

* `RJ-8`: Analog Devices
* `SM8`: Diodes Incorporated
* `SOT-28`: TopLine

### Dimensions

The SOT-23-8 has a different pitch to the other packages in the family of 0.65mm, so it can fit 4 leads on each side.

<Image src={sot_23_8_component_package_dimensions_diodes_incorporated} width="800px">Dimensions for the SOT-23-8 component package. Image from http://www.diodes.com/.</Image>

### Recommended Land Pattern

<Aside type="caution">
The `SOT-23-8` has a smaller pitch of 0.65mm compared to the `SOT-23-3`, `SOT-23-5`, and `SOT-23-6` which all have a pitch of 0.95mm. This is to fit the 4 pins on each side, the original `SOT-23` design (which is a synonym for `SOT-23-3`) only had room for a maximum of 3 pins per side.
