## Overview

`SOT-89` is a small, SMD family of component packages. There are two variants within the family, the `SOT-89-3` (with three leads, one of which is more like a tab), and the `SOT-89-5` (with 5 leads, again -- one of which is more like a tab).

All packages in this family have a number of rectangular leads and a central single tab-shaped lead. The tab-shaped lead improves the thermal performance of the package (decreases it's thermal resistance).

Synonyms:

* `2-5K1A` (Toshiba)[^bib-toshiba-2sc2873-ds]
* `SC-62` (JEITA)[^bib-toshiba-2sc2873-ds][^bib-nxp-sot89]
* `TO-243` (JEDEC)[^bib-nxp-sot89]

Similar To:

* `SOT-89-6`

Mounting: SMD

Pin Count: 3 (incl. tab-like lead)

Pitch: 1.50mm (between lead centers on the same side)[^bib-nxp-sot89]

Solderability: The package is relatively easy to solder by hand. There are no issues with hand soldering the tab since the tab produces on one side of the package.

Package Dimensions:

* Length: 4.5mm (nom)[^bib-nxp-sot89]
* Width: 2.5mm (nom)[^bib-nxp-sot89]
* Height: 1.5mm (nom)[^bib-nxp-sot89]

Common Uses:

* BJTs[^bib-toshiba-2sc2873-ds]

## SOT-89-5

The `SOT-89-5` package is commonly used as a SMD replacement for the `SIP-4` TH package. It call also be called the `SOT-89-6`, since it appears to have 6 leads when look down on the package.

### Thermal Resistance

www.diodes.com states their SOT-89-5 component package to have:

$$
\begin{align}
\theta_{JA} = 168^{\circ}C/W
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\theta_{JC} = 36^{\circ}C/W $$</div>
\end{align}
$$
