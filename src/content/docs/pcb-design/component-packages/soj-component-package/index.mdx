## Overview

SOJ (Small-Outline J-leaded package) is a SMD component package with many J-type folded leads. It has the same general package dimensions as the standard SOIC but with J-type leads rather than Gull-wing leads. Just like SOIC, it is commonly used to house integrated circuits (ICs).

All variants of the SOJ package seem to have a 1.27 mm (0.05") lead pitch, except for SOJ-4. 10.16mm (0.400") is a common body width for SOJ packages. Pin counts commonly vary from 16 to 40.

As of 2024, SOJ is not a commonly used SMD package. One advantage of the SOJ package is the bending resilience of the J-type leads before it is soldered. A SOJ package could be dropped from a fair height onto a hard surface without the leads bending. Packages with gull-wing leads such as [SOIC](/pcb-design/component-packages/soic-component-package/) or [QFP](/pcb-design/component-packages/qfp-component-package/) would not fare as well.

## Synonyms

* **PBG32**: Renesas's name for the SOJ-32 package[^renesas-pbg32-soj-32].

## Dimensions

According to EESemi[^eesemi-soj], the SOJ packages with 16 through 24 pins have a body width of 7.5mm and height of 2.9mm, while the SOJ packages with 28 through 40 pins have a body width of 10.16mm and height of 3.5mm. The lead pitch is 1.27mm.

## SOJ Sockets

You can purchase sockets for SOJ ICs so that you don't have to solder them onto the PCB. Below is a photo of a 40pin SOJ socket listed on eBay:

## Similar To

* PLCC: Another package with J-type leads.
* [SOIC](/pcb-design/component-packages/soic-component-package/): Like SOJ but with Gull-wing leads. More popular than SOJ.
