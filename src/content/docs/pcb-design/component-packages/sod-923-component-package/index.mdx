## Overview

`SOD-923` (Small Outline Diode 923) is a family of 2-lead SMD component packages. It contains two variants, the `SOD-923` and `SOD-923F`. 

Similar To:

* [SOD-123](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-123-component-package/) (largest)
* [SOD-323](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-323-component-package/) (much larger)
* [SOD-523](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-523-component-package/) (larger)
* [SOD-723](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-723-component-package/) (larger)


Pitch: 0.875mm[^bib-toshiba-sod-923]

Solderability: Reflow is most suitable. Possible to hand solder/reflow as long as experienced.

Package LxWxH: 1.0x0.6x0.4mm[^bib-toshiba-sod-923][^bib-centralsemi-sod-923pd]

Typical PCB Land Area: 0.72mmÂ² (1.2x0.6mm)[^bib-toshiba-sod-923]

3D Models:

Common Uses:

* ESD protection diodes
* Schottky diodes

## SOD-923 (Gull-wing Lead Variant)

The SOD-923 is similar to the SOD-923F, except the SOD-923 has pins protruding from the sides of the package and is not considered a "chip" package. The SOD-923 and SOD-923F have the same outer dimensions (when you include the pins in the SOD-923).

Synonyms:

* SC-116A (JEITA)

## SOD-923F (Flat Lead Variant)

The SOD-923F is similar to the [SOD-923](../sod-923-component-package), except that the SOD-923F does not have pins protruding past the end of the package and instead is a "chip" style package with the pins on the bottom face of the package. It is identical to the 0402 package commonly used for resistors and capacitor, however the `SOD-923F`` designation is typically used for diodes whilst `0402` is used for chip resistors and capacitors.

Synonyms:

* 0402
* 0402F (Comchip)[^bib-comchip-cdbqc0130l-hf]
