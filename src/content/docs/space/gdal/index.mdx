## Overview

The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a open-source software library for handling geospatial imagery data.

## RPC Metadata

The command-line tool `gdalinfo` will print the RPC metadata if present.

## Basic Reading/Writing Of GeoTiff Files

Updating the same file is the simplest example, as you don't have to worry about creating a driver:

```python
import gdal
ds = gdal.Open('image.tif', gdal.GA_Update)
img = ds.GetRasterBand(1).ReadAsArray()
# Change img as you see fit (it's a Numpy array)
ds.GetRasterBand(1).WriteArray(img)
ds = None
```

## Always Make Sure To dataset=None

Until a `dataset` object is set to `None` in Python, you cannot guarantee that all of the data has been written to the file system.

```python
ds = gdal.Open('image.tif')

## Do stuff here...

## Make sure to set the dataset to None, this will make sure all data
# is written out of buffers into file
ds = None
```

## Converting x, y Pixel Coordinates To Lat/Lons Using RPCs

RPC metadata can be embedded within an non-orthorectified image file. GDAL can use this RPC metadata to convert (or transform) co-ordinates in x, y pixels space into latitude/longitudes (and also to perform the reverse, to calculate x/y pixel co-ordinates from lat/lons).

You can do this in GDAL with a `Transformer` and the `TransformPoints()` function. However, these are quite poorly documented online (the benefit of `TransformPoints()` over `TransformPoint` is that you can do many points at once, making things more efficient).

```python
ds = gdal.Open('image_with_rpc_metadata.tif')

tr = gdal.Transformer(ds, None, ['METHOD=RPC'])

## TransformPoints requires the points to be in the same array, in the form:
# [ [x0, y0], [x1, y1], ... ]
xy_points = np.array([[0, 0], [5, 10], [10, 20]])
transformed_points, shape = tr.TransformPoints(0, xy_points)

# tranformed_points will be a list of tuples, in the form:
# [ (lon0, lat0, height0), (lon1, lat1, height1), ... ]
# where (lon0, lat0, height0) maps to (x0, y0)
```

## The geotransform

1. Top left X
1. W-E pixel resolution (pixel size y*sin(res))
1. Rotation
1. Top left Y
1. Rotation
1. N-S pixel resolution

The upper left corner of the upper left pixel will be placed at position gt[0], gt[3].

If your projection was to WGS84 (lat, lon) then:

```
gt[0]: Longitude of top left corner
gt[1]: cos(alpha)*W-E resolution
gt[2]: -sin(alpha_*W-E resolution)
gt[3]: Latitude of top left corner
gt[4]: sin(alpha)*N-S resolution
gt[5]: cos(alpha)*N-S resolution
```
