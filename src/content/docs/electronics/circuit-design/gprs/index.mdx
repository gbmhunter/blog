## Overview

GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) allows data to be sent over a cellular network (i.e. the same network cellphones use) in a cost-effective and efficient manner. It can be used on 2G and 3G.

## GPRS Modules

If you want to use GPRS for a project, unless you double as an RF and embedded brain-child, you want to buy a GPRS module. GPRS modules can also support CSM modes (the data transmission mode used for a typical phone call).

These modules usually use the AT command interface for communication. The reference guides for these are huge (100-1000 pages)!.

They can also have native support for speakers and microphones for phone calls, reducing the required number of external components. The amplifiers/receivers typically have noise reduction and echo supressors built in.

## Popular AT Commands

`AT+E1` - Enable echoing of commands  

`AT+E0` - Disable echoing of commands  

`AT+CGPRS` - Check to see if modem is in GPRS coverage  

`AT+MIPCALL` - Creates a wireless PPP connection with the server and returns a IP address for the modem  

`AT+CSQ` - Return signal strength (RSSI) and bit error information

## Examples

The Motorola G30 - A thin, flat SMD GPRS module. Features SIM support, an audio interface, and a SPI logger.
