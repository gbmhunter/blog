## Overview

Digital logic is the study and application of the fundamentals in digital (binary) electronics, e.g. gates, flip-flops, state machines.

See the [Gates page](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/gates/) for info on how NOT, AND, OR, NOR, and NAND gates work, what they are used for, 

See the [Latches and Flip-Flops page](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/latches-and-flip-flops/) for more information on how circuit "memory" can be made and how level-triggered latches and edge-triggered flip-flops work.
