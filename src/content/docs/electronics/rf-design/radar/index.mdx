## Overview

MIMO radar: Multiple-input multiple-output radar. A type of phased-array radar.

FMCW: Frequency-modulated continuous wave (which also uses the doppler effect)

Pulsed Doppler: The doppler effect applied to the reflected signal is used to calculate the objects velocity. When this type of radar is used in air craft, this also enables the reflection from the ground to be filtered out.
