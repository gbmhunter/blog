## Overview

Vaults are for storing design data.

import altium_vault_image from './altium-vault-image.png'

<Image src={altium_vault_image} width="300px">Depiction of the Altium vault.</Image>

## Personal Vault

The personal vault doesn't allow more than 3 connections at once.

## Adding Components

Components are best added to a vault from a component library (.CmpLib extension). Note that component libraries do NOT have the ability for "visible by default" component parameters!
