## Overview

_Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)_ is a measure of a devices ability to function in a shared operating environment (validated with susceptibility testing) whilst at the same time not effecting the ability for neighbouring equipment to function (validated with emissions testing).

Electronic devices both emit electrical noise and "absorb" noise from their environment. There are two main forms of emitted noise -- they emit radiated electromagnetic noise (noise that travels through the atmosphere) and conductive noise (noise that travels down any external electrical connections). Many electronic standards define maximum values of noise that a electronics device can emit, as well as levels of ambient noise that the device must functional properly within.

There are differing interpretations of what EMI and EMC stand for, be wary when reading articles (including this one!).

If you are interested in learning about the various EMC standard and tet procedures to meet them, see the [EMC Standards and Test Procedures page](emc-standards-and-test-procedures/).

If you want to learn how to design circuit schematics and PCBs which have low EMI and meet EMC regulations, see the [EMC Design Guidelines page](emc-design-guidelines/).
