## Overview

Voltage references are low power, extremely precise voltage supplies which are intended to provide a reference voltage for a circuit.

## Architectures

* Series
* Buried Zener
* Shunt

## Output Voltages

Common integer and half-integer voltages (e.g. 1.0V, 1.5V, 2.0V, 2.5V, 3.0V, 5.0V), standard logic supply voltages (1.8V, 3.3V) and 2^n voltages which make the maths easy when dealing with binary numbers (e.g. 1.024V, 2.048V).

## Manufacturer Part Numbers

* **MCP**: Microchip voltage references
