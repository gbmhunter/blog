## EEPROM

Even though flash is technically a form of EEPROM, the word EEPROM is usually reserved to smaller-memory, read/write/erase 1 byte at-a-time ICs (flash is usually erased in pages and has way more memory).

The cheapest EEPROM on the market is usually available with an I2C, 1-wire (e.g. UNI/O), or SPI-like (e.g. Microwire) interface, in packages such as the SOT-23-6, SOIC-8 and DIP-8.

### Unique IDs

Some EEPROM chips also come with unique ID's burnt into memory. The [DS28E05 by Maxim Integrated](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS28E05.pdf) is one such example. It provides a unique 64-bit ID number which can be read back from read-only memory. It also serves as it's 1-wire address.

## Flash

Flash sometimes uses flip-flop style pin naming conventions. The M25P128 is one such example.
