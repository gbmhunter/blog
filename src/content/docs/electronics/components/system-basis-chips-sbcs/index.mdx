## Overview

A system basis chip (SBC) is a integrated circuit which contains many of the functions of an automotive electronic control unit (ECU) on a single die[^wikipedia-system-basic-chip].

SBCs are offered by many IC manufacturers including:

* Texas Instruments
* NXP
* Infineon
* STMicroelectronics

SBCs are similar in functionality to power management ICs (PMICs). SBCs appear to have more of a automotive focus with the addition of CAN and LIN transceivers, along with the addition of automotive functional safety blocks (e.g. rated to ASIL-B, ASIL-D) such as fail-safe outputs.
