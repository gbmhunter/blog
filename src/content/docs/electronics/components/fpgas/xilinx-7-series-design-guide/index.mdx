## Overview

This is in no way meant to replace the comprehensive Xilinx design guides for 7 Series devices, but rather serve as a quick reference guide along with tips and tricks which may not be obvious from reading the official Xilinx material.

## IO

The pins in a bank are labelled something like `IO_L14P_T2_SRCC_14`. What does this mean?

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>IO</td>
      <td>This pin can be used as general IO.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>L14P</td>
      <td>This pin is part of a differential pair. The pair number is 14, and this is the positive (P) pin.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T2</td>
      <td>The pin is part of bank T2.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Decoupling Capacitors

Xilinx gives strict recommendations on the parameters of the capacitors used for decoupling. The following image shows a table with the ESL, ESR and body size limits for the various-valued capacitances.

<Aside type="note">
There is a range specified for the ESR, it is also bad to have too-little series resistance.
</Aside>

The Kintex and Virtex-7 devices has some in-built decoupling capacitors for the larger package sizes (you still need to add external decoupling caps, just not as many).

Reverse-aspect capacitors can be used for when ultra-low parasitic inductances are required.

## Un-used I/O Banks

Using a large device for a small project could mean that there are entire banks of unused I/O pins. In these cases you are allowed to leave the bank's `Vcco` pins (e.g. `Vcco_14`) and I/O pins disconnected. However, for ESD reasons, it is better to connect these pins to either (in order of preference): `GND`, a valid `Vcco` voltage, or a floating plane.

## MGTs

The Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs have in-built Multi-Gigabit Transceivers (MGTs). These are SerDes capable of 1Gbps+ transmission rates.

The MGTs on-board a 7 Series FPGA can be used to implement high-speed communication protocols such as PCIe (PCI Express).

The MGTs have decision-feedback equalisation (DFE) blocks, which aim to reduce the reduce the inter-symbol interference (ISI) on the current symbol.
