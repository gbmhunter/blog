## Overview

**PROFIBUS (Process Field Bus) is a serial communication protocol**. It was developed in a combined effort by the German government (BMBF), German companies and industry leaders in the late 1980s[^rt-automation-profibus]. The Profibus standards are maintained by both the _PROFIBUS User Organization_ (PNO) and _PROFIBUS International_ (PI). PROFIBUS can be used over a few different physical protocols:

1. [EIA-485 (RS-485)](/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-485-protocol).
1. Fiber optics.
1. MBP (Manchester Bus Powered) transmission.

You can purchase specialized PROFIBUS data cables.
