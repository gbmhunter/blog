## Overview

The _I3C communication protocol_ (pronounced eye-three-see) is a standard by the Sensor Working Group at the MIPI Alliance. The name is intended to indicate it's similarity to [I2C](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/), with the bus having the same two-wire _SCL_ and _SDA_ wires and being **backwards compatible with I2C** (with some caveats).

MIPI membership (and $$$) is required to get the full I3C specification. However, there is a publicly available subset of the full specification called MIPI I3C Basic, which can be downloaded for free from the [MIPI Alliance website](https://resources.mipi.org/mipi-i3c-basic-v1-download).

## History

The I3C standard was first released publicly by the MIPI Alliance in late 2017[^hindu-business-line-i3c-release], named _MIPI I3C v1.0_. MIPI Alliance members had access to the standard before this release date. _MIPI I3C Basic v1.0_ was released in October 2018. MIPI I3C v1.1 was released in December 2019[^mipi-i3c-sensor-specification].

## Comparison With I2C

The MIPI I3C Basic specification states that I3C has significant energy consumption and bus speed improvements over I2C:

The speed improvement over I2C is enabled mostly by the ability for I3C to **switch from open-drain to push-pull drive** in certain modes. I2C uses open-drain drive at all times, which limits the rise-time of the signal (the signal is pulled high by a "slow" resistor). I3C can switch from open-drain to push-pull once the initial bus arbitration has taken place, allowing much faster communication (up to rates comparable with SPI).

I3C does not need external pull-up resistors --- the pull-up resistors are provided by the I3C master(s).

## Backwards Compatibility With I2C

**I2C devices can be connected to an I3C bus** and communicate with I2C and I3C nodes at I2C bit rates. The standard allows the **bit rate to increase** when an I3C node is communicating with another I3C node. While I2C slaves are supported on an I3C bus, I2C masters are not (the master on a I3C must be a I3C device).
