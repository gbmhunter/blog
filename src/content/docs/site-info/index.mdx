## Site History

### 2004: Blog Started As "Kaboom Pyrotechnics"  

* Name: Kaboom Pyrotechnics
* Domain: [http://homepages.inspire.net.nz/~hunter](http://homepages.inspire.net.nz/~hunter)

This blog started of called "Kaboom Pyrotechnics". And yup, you guessed it, it solely contained information on how to make fireworks. It was initially designed in [Microsoft Front Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and then in [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver). These were both WYSIWYG editors!

### 2015: Updated To The Wordpress TwentyFifteen Theme

In 2015, in an attempt to simplify the aesthetics of the blog and reduce "clutter", the blog underwent it's biggest design transition --- from a dark-based theme (as shown above), to the custom light-based theme that was loosely based of the stock [Wordpress TwentyFifteeen theme](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/).

### 2017-03: Blog Moved To Subdomain blog.mbedded.ninja

* Name: mbedded.ninja
* URL: blog.mbedded.ninja
* Hosted By: GoDaddy (shared Linux hosting)
* Powered By: Wordpress

### 2017-12: Blog Moved From Wordpress To Hugo

* Name: mbedded.ninja
* URL: blog.mbedded.ninja
* Hosted By: [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
* Powered By: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

Migrated from Wordpress (full-blown CMS) to Hugo (static-site generator). The GitHub repo that the site is generated from can be found at [https://github.com/gbmhunter/blog](https://github.com/gbmhunter/blog).

### 2024-07 Blog Migrated From Hugo To Docusaurus

This lets me use React components in the markdown files, which is a big win compared to Hugos shortcodes. Hugo shortcode syntax is definitely not as nice as React and it's .jsx, and I have React experience from other projects. You couldn't easily nest/compose Hugo shortcodes either, whilst in React this is a trivial task.

This meant porting all the page content from markdown files using Hugo shortcodes for additional features such as images, admonitions to `.mdx` files using React components for the additional features.
