This page contains a number of videos I have recorded related to pyrotechnics. Included are videos of black powder tests, rocketry, fireball creation, and general pyrotechnics (anything from mortar firing to videos of the tools used for pyrotechnics).

## Mortar Test Fire

A homemade mortar test fire. Contained 5g of black powder with a section of 18mm wooden dowel on top. Mortar a 300mm long steel pipe with an internal diameter of 20mm.

## 100g Ball Mill

My old ball mill for grinding black powder. Made from a Nesquick milkshake can and a window wiper motor from an old car. There's about 20 lead balls inside and it can grind about 100g of black powder in 8 hours.

## Black Powder Unconfined Burn

This is an unconfined burn of 10g of homemade blackpowder. The black powder is not my best, as you can see by the sluggish burning and smoke emissions.

## 5min Rocket Take-off Failure

This rocket was built in under 5 minutes. It has a cardboard body and a black powder rocket motor. The nozzle plug of the rocket motor blew-off at take-off, resulting in almost no thrust.
