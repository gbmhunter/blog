New [Control Statements page](/programming/languages/c/control-statements) under Programming->Languages->C.

New Tools section under Electronics.

New info on [soldering flux](/electronics/tools/).

The [Javascript page](/programming/languages/javascript) was moved from under Website Design to under Programming Languages.

New [Varistors page](/electronics/components/varistors-vdrs/) under Electronics->Components.
