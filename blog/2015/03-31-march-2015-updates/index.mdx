The biggest update for March was the switch from a Linux/CPanel shared server to a managed Wordpress service, and the theme change to Avada! See the [Move To Managed Wordpress Hosting For Speed Increase post](/updates/2015/04/03/move-to-managed-wordpress-hosting-for-speed-increase) for more info.

A heap load of information added to the [USB Protocol page](/electronics/communication-protocols/usb-protocol).This includes oscilloscope images of surge currents on the VBUS trace. Added the child page [Chargers](/electronics/communication-protocols/usb-protocol/chargers).

Information on the body connection inside MOSFETs added to the [MOSFET page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets).

New page on [Made For Apple (MFi)](/electronics/circuit-design/made-for-ipod-iphone-ipad-mfi).

<Image src={require('./apple-logo.png').default} width="152px">The Apple logo.</Image>

New [WLCSP package](/pcb-design/component-packages/wlcsp-component-package) added to the Component Package database.

Added [Civil Footnotes plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civil-footnotes/) for adding footnotes to posts/pages.

Moved the info on buck converters from the Power Regulators page onto it's own [Buck Converters page](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/buck-converters/).

Moved the info on SEPIC converters from the Power Regulators page onto it's own [SEPIC Converters page](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/sepics/).

Moved the [Load Switches page](/electronics/circuit-design/load-switches/) so that it is a child of [Power Management](/electronics/circuit-design/power-management).

<Image src={require('./high-side-mosfet-load-switch-schematic.png').default} width="608px">A high-side load switch made from a N-Channel and P-Channel MOSFET.</Image>

New page on [Analogue Switches](/electronics/components/analogue-switches-transmission-gates/).

Information added about ESD Diodes On CMOS I/O to the ESD Protection page.

[SOT-1226](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-1226-2-component-package) added to the [Component Package Database](/pcb-design/component-packages).

<Image src={require('./sot-1226-component-package-3d-render-top-bottom.gif').default} width="166px">A 3D render of the SOD-1226 component package. Image from http://www.nxp.com/packages/sot1226.html.</Image>
