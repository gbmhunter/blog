title: Move To Managed Wordpress Hosting For Speed Increase
type: post
---

[blog.mbedded.ninja](/) has been moved from a Linux-based shared server on GoDaddy to one of their ["managed wordpress" services](https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/8926/what-is-managed-wordpress). It is about the same price, and instead of CPanel, they provide you with a pre-installed Wordpress CMS (with a powerful and quick import from existing Wordpress installation tool). The server is still shared, but is configured to run efficiently run Wordpress-based websites.

The idea was to hopefully speed things up, as [blog.mbedded.ninja](/) has been running really slow lately (30-60s load times!, see the [Site Running Slowly, Does That Mean It's Walking? post](/updates/2015/03/15/site-running-slowly-does-that-mean-its-walking)). So far so good, the page load times seem to have dropped dramatically. Now the front page takes 6.43s to load the first time, and 4.47s to load on a repeat view. See the screenshot below:

I think one of the big speed improvements came from the new way of caching. It suggests that the caching plugin I was using before was not working correctly.

At the same time, I decided to change themes. The reason behind this was because I wanted a "responsive" design, one that would look good on smart phones and tablets as well as the traditional computer monitor. Because I am no pro web designer, I wanted a framework to get me started, which I could then tweak to fit my needs. Call me a sheep, but I decided to go with the [Avada theme](http://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226), as it was very popular and had tons of good reviews.

It did cost a fair amount (US$58), so I was expecting it to be pretty easy to setup how I wanted to. Avada has a massive "Theme Options" menu that lets you customise many parts of the design. But I soon discovered that I had to make a child theme and edit both the PHP and CSS to get it to work to my liking. Maybe my requirements were just too specific? Things I had to use PHP/CSS for included:

* Resizing the websites logo to the desired size in the header
* Adding the site name and slogan to the header
* Colouring alternate rows of a table a different colour
* Adding a Revolution Slider to the header
* Remove the huge featured image from the start of every page

Because of the speed improvements, I still wouldn't go back to the Linux/CPanel style hosting, but a managed Wordpress service does have it's disadvantages:

* No CPanel! (most of the following disadvantages are sub-issues due to this fact!)
* No SSH, unless you pay for the Business or Pro managed Wordpress services (these are expensive), and even then, SSH is still limited
* No cron jobs
* No file manager (uploading many files is slow, as you can't upload a zip file and then unzip)

Thankfully, you do still get FTP access with the managed Wordpress service.
