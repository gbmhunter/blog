<p><b>And here are the visitors in 2017 by country:</b></p>

<Image src={require('./_assets/mbedded-ninja-2017-statistics-visitors-by-country.png').default} width="250px">The number of visitors to blog.mbedded.ninja in the year 2017, sorted by country.</Image>

<p>I think the biggest reason for the drop in visits (down 40%) in 2017 was due to the moving of
  <code>www.mbedded.ninja</code> to <code>blog.mbedded.ninja</code>. Even though www.mbedded.ninja was then setup
  to redirect to the new URL (you can click the above links if you don't believe me!), a significant drop in traffic was
  seen from this point onwards (I'm not that savvy on the details of SEO, but I guess it hurt the site's reputation).
  You can see the drop in the image below:</p>

<p>The total number of visits (ever) is now at 730k. Bring on 1 million!</p>

<p><b>Some things I would like the improve on the blog in 2018:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Move more and more images away from using image plugins, and instead use the default media handler.</li>
  <li>Add more child page sections to pages, and make sure each child page has both an image and a intelligible
    description.</li>
  <li>Boost visitor count back up to it's former levels (or better!) by improving content and SEO.</li>
  <li>Fully retire the use of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quicklatex/">QuickLatex plugin</a>, using
    <a href="https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/mathjax-latex/">MathJax-Latex plugin</a> for latex rendering instead.</li>
</ul>
