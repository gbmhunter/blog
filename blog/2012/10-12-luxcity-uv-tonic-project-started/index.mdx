I have been asked (by a mate who is studying architecture) to design and build a sequencing control system for 64 solenoids that control a mixture of UV tonic and air into a manifold of pipes to be pumped around a structure for a team participating in the Luxcity Project.

Their page can be found here ([http://stajegrouparchitects.wordpress.com/](http://stajegrouparchitects.wordpress.com/)), or a news article ([http://events.nzherald.co.nz/2012/luxcity/christchurch-city/christchurch](http://events.nzherald.co.nz/2012/luxcity/christchurch-city/christchurch)), or the Luxcity event page itself (http://www.luxcity.co.nz/, **as of Dec 2017, link unavailable**).
