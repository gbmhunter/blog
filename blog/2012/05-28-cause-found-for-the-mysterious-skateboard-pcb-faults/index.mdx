title: Cause Found For The Mysterious Skateboard PCB Faults
type: post

So I finally fixed the problems with the skateboard circuit boards...

The culprit, the flux! This stuff is acidic and makes solder stick better to the metal on the components. For some reason, this stuff was causing all the grief with the micro-controllers not programming and the LED's flashing sporadically. Maybe because I got it from my Dad, who used it when he was a kid? People were questioning me on whether it was a flux designed for PCB components or not, but it clearly says "soldering flux" on it.
