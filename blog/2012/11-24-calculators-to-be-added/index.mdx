I have finally worked out a nice way of creating and inserting topic-specific calculators onto Wordpress pages. The aim is to add them at useful points related to the topic being talked about. They are created using the plugin called "[EmbedIt Pro](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embedit-pro/)", which allows you to insert custom HTML code a specific points in a Wordpress page or post. The custom HTML code contains the calculator, which uses Javascript to provide calculator-like functionality.

For starters, an Ohm's Law calculator has been added to the [Resistors page](/electronics/components/resistors). It is very basic, expect functionality and appearance upgrades in the near future.
