* Added the [Happy New Year 2020 page](/), which compiles interesting blog statistics for the 2019 year.

* Renamed all leaf nodes filenames from `_index.md` to `index.md`, as using the former led to the tag pages not being created.

* Information on handling warnings has been added to the [Numpy page](/).

* Updated the [TSOC-6 Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/tsoc-component-package) with more clarification on the differences between the different variants (D6+1, D6-1, D6N+1 and D6N-1).

* Added a new [QFP Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/qfp-component-package), which will consolidate all of the variant information (e.g. TQFP) that existed on individual pages.

* Updated many component package pages, including:
    * [Micro3](/pcb-design/component-packages/micro3-component-package)
    * [SOT-23](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-23-component-package)
    * [SOT-346](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-346-component-package)
    * [TO-3](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-3-component-package)
    * [TO-39](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-39-component-package)

    And also added the following packages to the component package database:

    * [PDIP](/pcb-design/component-packages/pdip-component-package)
    * [SMT3](/pcb-design/component-packages/smt3-component-package)
    * [TO-23](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-23-component-package)
    * [TO-236AA](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-236aa-component-package)
    * [TO-236AB](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-236ab-component-package)

* Switched the site title and content title around in the HTML page title, such that it is now:

    ```
    <page title> | mbedded.nina
    ```

    This makes it easier to determine what the page is when you have a lot of tabs open on a tab-based browser such as Chrome or Edge.

* Added cached external content to the [How To Calculate Maximum Track Current page](/).

* Added more specific information about dynamic memory allocation on embedded systems to the [Dynamic Memory Allocation page](/).
