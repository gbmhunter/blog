* Updated the Python installation instructions.

* Created a new [Thermal Design For PCBs page](/pcb-design/thermal-design-for-pcbs).

* Removed the "upvote" shurikens that were on each page/post. [After introducing them about 1.5 years ago](/updates/2019/03-10-adding-shurikens) I have found they make the pages cluttered and don't work well on mobile devices, so I decided to axe the idea.

* Added a section on [Split-Gate MOSFETs to the MOSFET page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets#split-gate-mosfets).

* Adding a section on [stacking and concatenation to the Numpy page](/programming/languages/python/numpy).

* Added a page on [Thermal Cameras](/).

* Added a new page on [Inferential Statistics](/mathematics/statistics/inferential-statistics).

* Added information to the [Component Package page about leadframes](/pcb-design/component-packages#leadframes).
