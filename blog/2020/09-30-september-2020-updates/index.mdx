* Added info about [board packages to the Arduino page](/programming/microcontrollers/arduino).

    <Image src={require('/docs/programming/microcontrollers/arduino/arduino-logo.svg').default} width="200px"></Image>

* Added info about [schematic page templates to the A Beginners Intro To KiCAD page](/electronics/general/kicad/kicad-tips-and-tricks).

* Added support for the search service Algolia.

* Updated information about the `BC` range of BJTs on the [Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) page](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts).

    <Image src={require('/docs/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts/bc548-transistor-to92-photo.png').default} width="250px"></Image>

* Added more online simulation tools to the [Circuit Simulation page](/electronics/general/circuit-simulation).

* Added a new page on ~~555 Timer Circuits~~. Added a [555 timer calculator to NinjaCalc](https://ninjacalc.mbedded.ninja/calculators/electronics/ics/555-timer-astable-rt-rb-c) (which is also embedded on the 555 Timer Circuits page).

  **UPDATE 2021-05-22**: The 555 timer info has been moved to the [Timers And Multivibrators page](/electronics/components/timers-and-multivibrators).

* Updated the [Mbed Studio page](/programming/integrated-development-environments-ides/mbed-studio).

* Added a page on the [EasyScale communication protocol](/electronics/communication-protocols/easyscale-protocol).

* Migrated [NinjaCalc](https://ninjacalc.mbedded.ninja/calculators/electronics/ics/555-timer-astable-rt-rb-c) from a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) based app to [Next.js/React](https://nextjs.org/) based app. This took quite a long time to migrate, I'm estimating about 32 hours to migrate all functionality except for two calculators to Next.js. Deployments are now automatically done by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (I'm using the "Hobby" tier which is free forever). Unit/functional CICD testing has also been added with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Commit https://github.com/gbmhunter/NinjaCalc/commit/458137fb79237562acb8a3f3d09a13d30438bb49 was the beginning of the migration.

* Updated the [Cables page](/electronics/components/cables) with more information on cable insulation materials and combined power/data cables.

* Added a [Cable Gauge Calculator to the NinjaCalc app](https://ninjacalc.mbedded.ninja/calculators/electronics/cabling/wire-gauge-calculator).
