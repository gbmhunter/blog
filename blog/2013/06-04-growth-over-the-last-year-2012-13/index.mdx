title: Growth Over The Last Year (2012-13)
type: post
---

I installed the Wordpress Jetpack plugin just over a year ago, and with it came the  site statistics page, which gives you a nice overview of how many visitors visit your site. It has been interesting seeing the growth over the last year.

<Image src={require('./cladlab-growth-over-the-last-year.png').default} width="500px">Visitor number growth on cladlab.com over the last year (from May 2012 to May 2013).</Image>

The above image shows visitor growth per month on ~~\[www.cladlab.com\](www.cladlab.com)~~ over the last year (from May 2012 to May 2013). May 2012 has around 300 visitors, while May 2013 has just over 6,000!
