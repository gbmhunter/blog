This website has just hit 100,000 views! A bit of a milestone for the website!

This is the "official" 100k, the first real 100k would of been a little earlier, since the counter has not been around since the website's inception (e.g. back in 2004 when it was called Kaboom), and has been reset a few times (e.g. when moving from www.undergroundmadlabs.com to the current www.cladlab.com).
