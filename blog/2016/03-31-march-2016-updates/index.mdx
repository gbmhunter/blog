* New info on [mains power connectors](/electronics/components/connectors/#mains-power-connectors).

* Updates to the [SPI Protocol page](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/) under Electronics->Communication Protocols.

* New info on [PTC Type thermistors](/electronics/components/ptc-resettable-fuses/).

* Updates to the [D2PAK (TO-263) Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/d2pak-component-package/), with more info on the TO-263 THIN package.

* New [4-20mA Current Loop page](/electronics/communication-protocols/4-20ma-current-loops/), under Electronics->Communication Protocols.  

    <Image src={require('./_assets/4-20ma-current-loop-interface-to-micro-schematic-with-filter-and-buffer.png').default} width="800px">An schematic showing how to interface a 4-20mA current loop signal to the ADC on a microcontroller. The circuit also has a low-pass filter and a buffer.</Image>
    
* Updates to the [D-sub Connectors page](/electronics/components/connectors/d-subminiature-d-sub-connectors/) including info about filtered D-sub connectors and the various sizes and shapes of D-sub connectors.
