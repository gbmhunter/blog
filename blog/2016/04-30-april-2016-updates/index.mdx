* Added information about [multiple-collector and multiple-emitter BJTs](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts#multiple-collector-and-multiple-emitter-bjts).

    <Image src={require('./_assets/basic-two-input-tll-nand-gate-schematic.png').default} width="499px">The schematic of a basic two-input TTL NAND gate.</Image>

* Information added on using low-pass RC filters for making a VDAC from a PWM source.

* Added information about the [10-bit I2C addressing scheme](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/).

* New [How To Calculate Track Current page](/pcb-design/how-to-calculate-maximum-track-current) under the PCB Design section of the website, with information, equations, and more info on how to calculate the maximum current a track (a.k.a. trace) on a PCB can take.

* Added new info on [NTC thermistor temperature sensing](/electronics/components/sensors/temperature-sensors/) with information on PTC and NTC thermistors, including how to connect them up to a microcontroller for temperature measurements.

* New [MicroBlaze page](/programming/microcontrollers/microblaze/) under Programming->Microcontrollers.

* New [Z-Wave page](/electronics/communication-protocols/z-wave) under Electronics->Communication Protocols.

* New information about the common-collector BJT amplifier.
