## Updates This Month

* A new page on [Probabilities](/mathematics/statistics/probabilities/). Added info on it about how to generate random numbers that follow a specific distribution.

* Updated the Resistors page from Markdown to AsciiDoc format.

* Added a red horizontal bottom boarder to all `h2` headings in the main content of each page.

* Added parasitic models of resistors.

* Consolidated all the info on non-isolated switch-mode power supplies (e.g. buck converters, boost converters, buck-boost, SEPIC, Ćuk) into a [single page](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/). And then added more info, as well as updating the basic schematics of the various topologies to match this site's style.

* Added info on MQTT clients suitable for embedded devices.

* Expanded the TOC to contain heading levels 2 to 4 (beforehand it was only showing level 2).

* Added the ability to define multiple authors per page, and added an author block to all content pages. Followed a really useful tutorial at https://moonbooth.com/hugo/authors/.

* Added a safe operating area (SOA) graph to the BJT page, and added information on secondary breakdown.

* Added info and schematics on adding protection diodes to linear regulators.

* Added info on low-dropout linear regulators.

* Updated the Ethernet page with info on [serial-to-ethernet ICs](/electronics/communication-protocols/ethernet-protocol/).

* New [AWS IoT page](/programming/cloud/aws/aws-iot/).

* New [Isolated Switch Mode Power Supplies page](/electronics/components/power-regulators/isolated-switch-mode-power-supplies/), with info on flyback converters including basic schematics and feedback using optoisolators.
    <Image src={require('./flyback-converters-screenshot.png').default} width="400px"></Image>

* Added info on how to design foldback current limiting with a linear regulator.
