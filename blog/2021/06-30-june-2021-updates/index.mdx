## Updates This Month

* Combined the "Passing A C++ Member Function To A C Callback" page into the "C++ Callbacks" page. Updated the page with much more info, including worked examples which use https://replit.com/@gbmhunter for hosting, compiling and running small snippets of C++ code.

* Updated the [Electrical Noise page](/electronics/circuit-design/electrical-noise/) with info on the various "Colours of Noise" including graphs (in both the time and frequency domains) of white, pink, red, and blue noise.

* Removed the "Test And Measurement" section of the site. Moved the only page underneath it (the "Current Probes" page) to under "Tools" instead.

* Added new info on [AC/DC Electronic Loads](/electronics/tools/#acdc-electronics-loads).

* Added info on [Line Impedance Stabilization Networks (LISNs)](/electronics/tools/#lisns).

* The main structure of this sites HTML was updated to use Bootstrap containers and columns to create a responsive layout. At the same time, the main menu was updated from a hover-based tree view to a expandable tree view which should be more friendly towards users with touch screen devices. The Table of Contents for pages is now also added at a fixed location in a right-hand column for large screen devices.
