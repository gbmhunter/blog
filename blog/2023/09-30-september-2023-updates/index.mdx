* A lot of work was done on [NinjaTerm](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/)!
    * Migrated from an Electron App to a PWA (Progressive Web App).
    * The homepage needed some love, half the .gifs were broken and showed out-of-date content. I embraced the dark side and [remade the homepage](https://ninjaterm.mbedded.ninja/) with a dark theme that matched the theme of the app. I also migrated it from using GitHub pages to being part of the app itself, meaning only 1 website to deploy, not two.

    * Added support for more ANSI Escape Codes.

* Added info on [stuck (hung) I2C buses and how to recover from them](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/#stuck-i2c-buses).
    <Image src={require('./stuck-i2c-buses-screenshot.png').default} width="600px"></Image>

* Added info on [I2C start conditions, address bytes, data bytes and stop conditions](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-communication-protocol/#protocol-format).

* Added info on providing clearance on PCBs for screw heads.

* Added more info to the [Current Sensing page](/electronics/circuit-design/current-sensing/). 

* Added new page on [hall effect sensors](/electronics/components/hall-effect-sensors/).
