Migrated this site from Hugo to Docusaurus. The main reason for this was to take advantage of the more modern React-based framework that Docusaurus provides, as well as the ability to use MDX for content pages. MDX allows you to embed React components within it when you want to add functionality to page above and beyond what standard markdown provides. Over the last 5 years I had found Hugo's shortcode syntax to be a bit clunky and difficult to work with, and I was looking for a more modern solution. Given I am already familiar with React due to the NinjaTerm and NinjaCalc projects, Docusaurus seemed like a good fit. It also has a built in theme which suited this site well, reducing development time.

The Docusuaurus theme should have much better responsive design than my self-writted Hugo theme.

Added new info on the [MAHD (Modified Agile for Hardware Development) project management methodology](/project-management/mahd/).
