Probably one of the biggest months of updates ever!

* Added [minicom page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/minicom).

* Added [cat page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/cat).

* Info on variadic macros added to Programming->Languages->C->[C Preprocessor](/programming/languages/c/preprocessor).

* New [Memory page](/programming/general/memory) under General Programming

* Updated [Alitum Simulation page](/electronics/general/altium/altium-simulation).

    <Image src={require('./frequency_response_01.jpg').default} width="700px">A first-order high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 15.9kHz.</Image>

* New page on the Linux program [diff](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/diff).

* New page on [C variadic functions](/programming/languages/c/variadic-functions) (to complement the stuff added about variadic macros)

* New PSoC Fault Finding page.

* New [Automated Code Analysis page](/programming/general/automated-code-analysis).

* Git repo Code-Template-Files added

* New Compilers section under Programming with [GCC page](/programming/compilers/gcc).

* New page, How To Properly Use FreeRTOS (**as of Dec 2017, URL unavailable**).

* New pages, [Naming Conventions](/programming/general/naming-conventions), under Programming->General, and [C Naming Conventions](/programming/languages/c/c-naming-conventions), under Programming->Languages->C.

* Removed Disqus ads.

* New page, Programming->Languages->C->[Standards And Versions](/programming/languages/c/standards-and-versions).

* Version Control Systems promoted to a sub-menu of Programming.

* New commands added to the [.](/programming/version-control-systems/mercurial/mercurial-speed-guide)

* New page, Programming->Languages->C->Portability.

* Updates to the Programming->Languages->C->[Pointers page](/programming/languages/c/pointers).

* Added information about the C ternary operator (?) to the Programming->Languages->C->[Logical Operators page](/programming/languages/c/logical-operators). Also added information about the lack of a logical exclusive OR operator, and how to simulate one.

* Updates to the Programming->Languages->C->[Structures page](/programming/languages/c/structures) regarding initialisation and object-orientated style programming.

* Updates to the Programming->Languages->C->[Enumerations page](/programming/languages/c/enumerations), adding info about how to change the data type of enumerations and enumeration syntax.

* New page, Programming->Operating Systems->FreeRTOS->[Common Mistakes](/programming/operating-systems/freertos/common-mistakes). Added info about the `main()` stack getting overriden when `vTaskStartScheduler()` gets called.

* PCB Design got promoted to be a sub-menu of Electronics.

* New component package added, [SOD-123F](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-123f-component-package/), to the [Component Packages page](/pcb-design/component-packages/).

    <Image src={require('./component-package-sod-123f-3d-model-2.jpg').default} width="500px">A 3D model of the SOD-123F component package.</Image>

* New GitHub repo, [TemplateCodeFiles](https://github.com/gbmhunter/TemplateCodeFiles), which currently contains template code for the C and C++ languages.

* New GitHub repo, [FreeRtosWrapper-Cpp](https://github.com/gbmhunter/FreeRtosWrapper-Cpp). Contains wrappers to use FreeRTOS in a object-orientated C++ environment, including the ability to make a class function (a method), a task.

* Corrected some info on the [Using C++ With PSoC Creator page](/programming/microcontrollers/psoc/using-cplusplus-with-psoc-creator), and added more info about thread-safe static initialisation and virtual functions.

* New section Methodologies under Programming. New page Inversion of Control (IoC) (**as of Dec 2017, URL unavailable**).

* New page on [PCB Stencils](/pcb-design/soldermask-stencils/) under Electronics->PCB Design. This includes information of the different etching processes as well as terminology such as aperture size and aspect ratio.

* Updated to the [RingBuff-Cpp](https://github.com/gbmhunter/RingBuff-Cpp) GitHub repo.

    <Image src={require('./github-ringbuff-readme-screenshot.png').default} width="500px"></Image>

* Updates to the [Microcontroller IDE Comparison page](/programming/general/microcontroller-ide-comparison) relating to AVR Studio.

* New page on [PCB Castellation](/pcb-design/castellation/).
