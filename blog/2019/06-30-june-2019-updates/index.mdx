* The page on [Electrical Noise](/electronics/circuit-design/electrical-noise) moved from Electronics->Test And Measurement to Electronics->Circuit Design.

* Renamed the Fast Fourier Transform page to the [Fourier Transform page](/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms), as it now contains information about other Fourier transforms.

* Added graphs of 1D Fourier transformations:

    and animated .gifs of 2D Fourier transformations:

    <Image src={require('/docs/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms/sinusoidal.gif').default} width="400px"></Image>

* Updated the pytest page with info on `mark` (markers) and `pytest` naming conventions.

* Removed the `updates` directory that all monthly update posts were under.

* Added a [tutorial on pandas](/programming/languages/python/pandas), a popular data analytics library for Python.

* Updated the [Python Debugging page](/programming/languages/python/python-debugging) with more info on `pdb`.

* Updated the [Filters page](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters) with more information on low-pass RC filters, including plots of the frequency response:

    <Image src={require('/docs/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/_assets/rc-low-pass-filter-frequency-response.png').default} width="500px"></Image>

* I created a public mbedded.ninja project on CircuitMaker at [https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/GeoffreyHunter/mbedded-ninja](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/GeoffreyHunter/mbedded-ninja). I am going to trial out CircuitMaker as a tool for drawing schematic diagrams for this blog. In the past I have used Altium (not free), MultisimLive and InkScape (free but is a general vector graphics editor, not a dedicated electronics CAD program).

* Added the [Command-Line CSV Viewer page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/command-line-csv-viewer), which contains information on how to cleanly view CSV files from the Linux command-line.

* Added a [new page about the programming language Julia](/programming/languages/julia).
