* The [Component Schematic Symbols and Designators page](/electronics/circuit-design/component-schematic-symbols-and-designators) was updated. The mobile unfriendly one-big-table design was removed in favour of separate sections for each component and designator/schematic symbol. Some of the symbols were also updated using InkScape.

* The PCB Design Tools section of the main PCB Design page was moved onto it's own [PCB Design Tools page](/pcb-design/pcb-design-tools).

* All section on the main PCB Design page regarding PCB layers were moved into their own new [PCB Layers page](/pcb-design/pcb-layers).

* Big updates to the [Convolution page](/programming/signal-processing/convolution), including the addition of a worked example where the convolution of two box-car functions is calculated.

    <Image src={require('./convolution-two-box-car-functions.gif').default} width="500px">An animated .gif showing the convolution of two box-car functions. The value of the convolution function at any time t (bottom line in red) is the amount area shown in red in the middle plot, which is the area under the curve of f(t)g(t) (the two waveforms multiplied together).</Image>

* Added a new page on [less](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/less), the basic Linux command-line utility for displaying text.

* Added a new [Image Processing subsection](/programming/signal-processing/image-processing) under Programming->Signal Processing. Added a new [Morphology page](/programming/signal-processing/image-processing/morphology) under the Image Processing section.

* Addition of information on `git commit --fixup` and `git log` to the [git page](/programming/version-control-systems/git).

* Addition of ownership (`chown`) information to the [Users, Groups, And Permissions In Linux page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/users-groups-and-permissions-in-linux).

* Added a `LICENSE.txt` (containing the MIT license) to many of my Git repos, including:

    * [CppLinuxSerial](https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppLinuxSerial)

    * [LinuxCanBus](https://github.com/gbmhunter/LinuxCanBus)
    * [YoctoHelloWorldApp](https://github.com/gbmhunter/YoctoHelloWorldApp)

* Released `v5.0.0` of [MPid](https://github.com/gbmhunter/MPid), which included the following changes:
    * Added .gitignore file.
    * Added `LICENSE.txt` (MIT license).
    * Replaced Make build script with CMake.
    * Replace the custom four number versioning with the standardized semantic versioning (three number).
    * Changed README from ReStructuredText to Markdown format.

* Updates to the [rsync page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/rsync) including a redesign of the _Options_ section.
