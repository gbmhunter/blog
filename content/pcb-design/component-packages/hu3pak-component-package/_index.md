The `HU3PAK` component package is a package design used solely by ST Microelectronics. It's designed attached to a heatsink on it's top surface, but unusually does not have any provision for thermally coupling to the PCB (the recommended footprint only has a small amount of soldering points for the 7 pins and two tab locations).

The only use I could find for this package is for MOSFETs.
