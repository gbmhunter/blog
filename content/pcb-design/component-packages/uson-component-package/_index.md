## Overview

USON (Ultra-thin Small Outline No-lead Package) is the JEDEC name for a family of SMD component packages that is very similar to [DFN](/pcb-design/component-packages/dfn-component-package/) packages.

The [http://www.ti.com/packaging/docs/searchtipackages.tsp?packageName=SON](Texas Instruments Package Search - SON) page contains information on all of the `USON` packages that TI components use.

## Synonyms

* PG-USON: Infineon.

## Dimensions

There are two many variants in the USON family to list all the dimensions here. Below is one example to give an idea on their size:

## Similar To

* [DFN](/pcb-design/component-packages/dfn-component-package/): DFN is very similar USON in that the leads are normally on only two sides of the package.
* [WSON](/pcb-design/component-packages/wson-component-package/)
