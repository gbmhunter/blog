## Comments

The `LGA` package is is a surface mount package with pads on the underside of the package. It is very similar to the link:/pcb-design/component-packages/bga-component-package/[BGA package], except is does not have any balls, instead plain flat pads are used. An `LGA` package may also differ from `BGA` with the addition of arbitrary sized pads for purposes such as grounding, thermal dissipation, shielding and mechanical strength. An LGA package can be made from a PCB, thus many LGA components are actually entire "modules" made from a PCB and a number of components. This modular form is commonly seen with cellular modem and WiFi components.

|===

The LGA package comes in many different variants, all which have a different number of pins and a different pin configuration. The pins are normally lines up in a grid of x columns and y rows, but not every position may have a pad. Therefore you can get variants with the same LGA package width and length.

Like BGAs, LGA packages can withstand up to 50% mis-alignment when soldering (50% of the distance between consecutive pads, i.e. it's pitch), as the package will automatically align itself<<bib-nxp-lga-rework>>. LGA packages can be connected to the PCB either with a socket or direct soldering. Intel has popularised the package by using it on some of it's CPU families.

## Shifted Solder Mask Layouts

Sometimes LGA components recommend unique paste mask designs with "shifted" openings, as shown below.
