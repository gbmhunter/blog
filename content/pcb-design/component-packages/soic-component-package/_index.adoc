| Variants
| The SOIC family contains packages with a varying number of pins. There are also two width's for SOIC packages, narrow width (3.9mm wide body, `SOICx_N`) and wide width (7.5mm wide body, `SOICx_W`). The width is usually expressed by the addition of `_N` or `_W` to the end of the package name. If the width is not mentioned, it is most likely going to be narrow width.

| Mounting

| Pin Count
| 8, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32

| Pitch
a|

## SOIC-xN

The SOIC-xN (SOIC narrow) family of packages is governed by the JEDEC MS-012-AA standard. There are non-exposed (normally just referred to as SOIC-x or SOIC-xN) and exposed pad versions (which are normally indicated with an "E" in the package name<<bib-mps-mp2497-a-ds>>). 

The dimensions for the `SOIC-8N` package are shown below:

.The dimensions for the SOIC-8N component package.

The dimensions for the `SOIC-16N` component package are shown below:

.The dimensions for the SOIC-16N component package.
image::soic-16-component-package-dimensions.jpg[width=575px]

Land area:

* SOIC-8: 29.4mm2

Thermal resistance:

* SOIC-8: 70.6K/W (pads only, no copper fill)
* SOIC-8: 55K/W (6cm2 of copper, ground pins attached internally to die)
* SOIC-8: 33.5K/W (1 square inch of copper surrounding package, connected to ground)

## SOIC-xW

The `SOIC-xW` (SOIC wide) family of packages is governed by the JEDEC MS-013 and IEC 075E03 standards. NXP's `SOT-162-1` package is a SOIC-16W<<bib-nxp-sot162-1>>.

|===
| Package Name | Land Area

| SOIC-16W     | 136.3mm² (11.9x11.45mm)<<bib-nxp-sot162-1>>
| SOIC-28W     | 186.4mm² (10.3x18.1mm)

## Pitch

Most `SOIC` packages have a pitch of 1.27mm (50mil) and usually have Gullwing leads. When used for regulators, sometimes the many ground pins are connected internally to the die attach flag, providing better heat sinking capabilities. SOIC packages use _leadframe_ technology.

The `SOIC` package `R-PDSO` defined by JEDEC has a non-standard pitch of 0.65mm (and the standard wide body width of 7.5mm).

## Pin Numbering

Pin numbering is the same as a `DIP` package, in that pin 1 is at the top left, and then pins are numbered sequentially down the left-hand side, then up the right hand-side.

## Polarity Marks

There are three ways of indicating the polarity on a `SOIC` package. The first two, a dot or a notch, indicate pin 1 or the top of the chip. The third way is not so obvious, and features a bevelled edge along the side that pin 1 is on (so for `SOIC-8`, the bevelled edge would be on the side with pins 1 to 4).

## Related Packages

The `WSON` package by SST is lower in height than a standard `SOIC` package, but is designed to use the same PCB footprint.

## Adapter PCBs

Adapter PCBs for the `SOIC` family of packages are widely available due to the popularity of the package.

SparkFun makes a `SOIC-8` to `DIP-8-300` adapter PCB.

## Standard Pinout For MOSFETs

The `SOIC-8` component package is commonly used for medium-power N and P-channel MOSFETs. Most of these MOSFETs have the exact same pinout (both N and P-Channels!), as shown in the below diagram.

Note: As far I'm aware, this is not specified in any standard, but is just an industry default. Also, this only applies to `SOIC-8` packages with 1 MOSFET inside them.

## SOIC-4 (SO-4)

The `SO-4` package is quite unique from other `SO` packages. It typically has the same mechanical dimensions as a `SO-6` package, but has the two middle pins on either side removed. Typically the `SO-6` pin numbering is also kept, such that the remaining pins are numbered 1, 3, 4 and 6. Due to the large clearances between the pins and on the package, this `SO-4` package is used for optical isolators.

The `SO-4` package is different to the `SOIC-4` package, even though these two different names refer to the same package at higher pin counts.

ON Semiconductor uses the case code `751EP` for the `SOIC-4W` package<<bib-on-semiconductor-bridge-rectifier>>.
