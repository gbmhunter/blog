## Overview

SOT-1040-1 (Small Outline Transistor 1040-1) is a component package exclusively used by NXP for some of their RFID inlays. I'm not sure why they labelled it as a "SOT" package, as it is very different from everything else in this range.

It is also called the "Plastic Flip Chip Strap Package".
