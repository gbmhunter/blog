WARNING: This page is in notes format, and may not be of the same quality as other pages on this site.

Unfortunately, most surface-mount crystals do not come in named packages. A notable exception is the link:/pcb-design/component-packages/hc-49us-component-package/[HC-49US package]. This page contains info on the unnamed SMD crystal packages, which are usually identified by their width*length. There are a variety of popular width*length combinations used.
