|===

The `SOD-882` component package is quite different from many other SOD packages (such as `SOD-323`, `SOD-523`) in that it's pads are on the underside of the package rather than gull-wing or flat leads (when the `F` suffix is used). This makes the `SOD-882` very similar to a standard DFN package.
