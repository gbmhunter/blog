## TO-218-3 (3 Lead Variant)

<<to-218-package-dimensions-on-semi>> shows the dimensions of the TO-218-3 component package.

When housing a BJT, the pinout is usually:

* 1: Base
* 2: Collector
* 3: Emitter
* 4 (Tab): Collector

## TO-218-1 (1 Lead Variant)

Fairchild Semiconductor has dimensions for a "single-lead" TO-218 package, as shown in <<to-218-single-lead-dimensions-fairchild-semiconductor>>. Curiously, I have not found any components that use this package.
