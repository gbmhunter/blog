`SOD-128` is a package used by a few manufacturers for diodes. I could not find any JEITA (EIAJ) code (e.g. `SC-xxx`) for this package. ST Microelectronics calls this package the `SOD-128 FLAT` (presumably because it has flat leads, as opposed to many SOD packages which by default have gull-wing leads, and only offer flat variants once you add a `F` suffix)<<bib-st-sm6fxxay-ds>>. There does not appear to be any difference between the ST Microelectronics `SOD-128 FLAT` package and the `SOD-128` as labelled by Rohm and Nexperia.

## Thermal Resistance

* stem:[R_{JA} = 200^{\circ}{\rm C}/W] (standard land pattern, see below)
* stem:[R_{JA} = 120^{\circ}{\rm C}/W] (mounting pad for cathode 1cmÂ²)
* stem:[R_{JA} = 60^{\circ}{\rm C}/W] (mounted on ceramic PCB with standard footprint)
