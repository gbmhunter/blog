## Comments

_MiniMELF_ is a cylindrical, surface mount component package whose most common use is for packaging diodes and resistors. This package often comes under the alternative names _SOD-80_ or _DO-213AA_. I prefer to call it MiniMELF as it's to remember when there are a plethora of other packages under the "SOD" or "DO-" naming convention.

MiniMELF (and all the other packages in the MELF family) are cylindrical shaped components. This makes them somewhat infamous because they have a tendency to roll around when soldering. This leads to the backronym "MELF: **M**ost **E**nd up **L**ying on the **F**loor" or being called the "roll away" package. However, they remain popular because offer significant advantages over traditional SMD packages including:

* High accuracy
* Moisture resistance
* High-temperature operation
