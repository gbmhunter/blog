## Comments

The WSON package has a exposed thermal pad on the underside. However, it is not normally electrically connected to anything, and is optionally soldered to the PCB. It is recommended to be soldered when the PCB has a large amount of flex, else left unconnected.

Texas Instruments has a WSON package which does not have a pitch of 1.27mm!

Below is an "odd shaped" SON package used by Numonyx flash chips that goes under the name VDFPN8. Notice the half-round appearance of the pins.

Atmel produces a document titled [PCB Design Considerations when Changing from 6-pin SOT23 to 6-pin WSON Atmel Products](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/QAN0027_6-Pin-SOT23-to-6-Pin-WSON_1_05.pdf). It is a good read if you are migrating from larger SOT-23 packages to the smaller WSON package.

## The DMB/PWSON Package (Texas Instruments)

The `DMB` package (also called `PWSON`) is a variant of the `WSON` package used by Texas Instruments. It has a pitch of 1mm. The [HDC1080 datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/hdc1080.pdf) is an example of a TI component which comes in the `DMB` package.

## The DQD Package (Texas Instruments)

The `DQD` package is a variant of the `WSON` package used by Texas Instruments. The [TPD8F003 datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tpd8f003.pdf) is an example of a TI component which comes in the `DQD` package.

3D model exist for some of the DQD packages on 3DContentCentral, for example:

* [WSON-12 (DQD)](https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/download-model.aspx?catalogid=171&id=1025763)
* [WSON-16 (DQD)](https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/download-model.aspx?catalogid=171&id=1025762)
