## Overview

The `SOT-490` (Small-outline Transistor 490) is a 3-lead SMD component package primarily used for transistors.

Synonyms:

* 463C-03 (On Semiconductor)[^bib-on-semi-sc-89-3]
* SC-89-3 (JEITA)
* SOT-490

Pitch: 1.00mm[^bib-on-semi-sc-89-3]

Package LxWxH: 1.60x1.60x0.58mm[^bib-on-semi-sc-89-3]

Typical PCB Land Area: 2.49mmÂ²[^bib-on-semi-sc-89-3]

Solderability: Reflow is most suitable. Possible to hand solder/reflow as long as experienced.

Similar To:

* SC-89-6

The SC-89-3 has the same package dimensions as the SC-89-6, but just with half the leads missing (similar to the SOT-23-3 vs. SOT-23-6).
