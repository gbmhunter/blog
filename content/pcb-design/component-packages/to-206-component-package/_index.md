## Overview

The `TO-206` (Transistor Outline Package, Case Style 206) component package is a family of large through-hole metal can packages used for things such as transistors. There are variants with anywhere from 2 to 8 leads[^wikipedia-to-18].

Synonyms:

* `TO-18`

Variants:

* `TO-206-AA`: Represents what was typically called `TO-18`.
* `TO-206-AB`: 3-lead with 1.90mm cap height. Also called `TO-46`.[^wikipedia-to-18] 
* `TO-206-AC`: 3-lead with 3.30mm cap height. Also called `TO-52`.[^wikipedia-to-18]
* `TO-206-AF`: 4-lead. Also called `TO-72`.
* `TO-71`: 8-lead `TO-18`.

Common Uses

* Diodes (`TO-18-2`)
* Transistors (`TO-18-3`)

## TO-206-AA

The `TO-206AA` component package used to be referred to as just as `TO-18`. National Semiconductor called this package `H03C`[^ti-metal-can-packages].
