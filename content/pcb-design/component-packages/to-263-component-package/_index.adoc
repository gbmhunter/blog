## The Standard Package (TO-263)

The TO-263 package can be considered the SMD version of the `TO-220AB` package. It is a 3, 5 or 7 leaded heavy-duty SMD package that allows for good heat-sinking due to a large pad on it's underside. It is used frequently for high power MOSFETs, LDOs and SMPS. Comes with either a normal middle lead (X2 = nothing) or a short, cut-off middle lead (X2 = S).

## TO-263-3

The `TO-263-3` is the 3-pin variant of the `TO-263`.

The junction-to-ambient thermal resistance for the `TO-263-3` component package on both standard JEDEC 2-layer and 4-layer boards is shown below:

* stem:[T_{JA} = 18.0^{\circ}{\rm C}/W] (1 square inch of copper surrounding pads, connected to ground)
* stem:[T_{JA} = 33.6^{\circ}{\rm C}/W] (copper filling package land-area)
* stem:[T_{JA} = 36.7^{\circ}{\rm C}/W] (pads only, no copper fill)

## TO-263-5

The `TO-263-5` is the 5-pin variant of the `TO-263`.

Thermal resistance of the TO-263-5L THIN:

stem:[T_{JA} = 22.0^{\circ}{\rm C}/W] (no air flow, on JEDEC 4-layer test board)

## TO-263 THIN

`TO-263 THIN` is a variant of the `TO-263` component package by Texas Instruments. It shares a similar PCB footprint, but is significantly smaller in height (i.e. thinner).

It still has a similar exposed pad on it's underside (making it footprint compatible with the standard `TO-263` package).

The exact dimensions of the `TO-263 THIN` package are shown in <<to-263-thin-component-package-dimensions>>.
