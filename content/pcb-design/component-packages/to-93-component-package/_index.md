## Overview

TO-93 (Transistor Outline 93) is a large panel mount component package used for high-power SCRs and thyristors[^vishay-to-209ab-to-93]. It has good heat-sinking capabilities. Thread is 28.5mm in diameter, so fits 29-30mm hole. The metal case/thread is usually used as the anode, and the thick cable the cathode (there normally is a flying lead for the cathode also), along with a white flying lead for the gate.
