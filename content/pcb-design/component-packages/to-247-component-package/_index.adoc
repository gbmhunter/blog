## TO-247AC (TO-247-3)

The `TO-247AC` (a.k.a. `TO-247-3`) is the 3-pin variant of the TO-247 package. It is considered the "upgrade" of the TO-218 (SOT-93), with the main difference being the insulated mounting hole, making it easier to mount to a heatsink without shorting things out (it is "mechanically compatible" with the TO-218, however not identical!<<bib-on-semi-package-change>>).

When containing a MOSFET, the pin wiring is usually:

1. Gate
2. Drain
