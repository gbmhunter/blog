## Comments

The most common through-hole package for diodes. The common (1N400x) series of diodes comes in this package. The typical rated current for a diode in this package is 1A.

This package is normally mounted on the PCB in two ways, either flat with the legs bent at 90° to fit into the holes, or in space-constrained applications, vertical, with one of the legs straight and one bent 180° to fit into the holes in the PCB (which are closer together than when in the flat orientation. Material of package is normally molded plastic.
