## Comments

`SOT-23` is a very common surface-mount package that is used for a huge number of functions. Variations exist with 3 to 8 pins. When surface mount components were just beginning to gain popularity, `SOT-23` was introduced to replace the well used through-hole 3-pin TO-18 and TO-92 transistor packages, and so the first variant of SOT-23 was the 3 leaded version (SOT-23-3, officially called TO-236AA by JEDEC).

The SOT-23 family probably has the largest number of differing variant names which all refer to the same packages (see the synonym section above).

{{< img src="sot-23-component-package-photo.jpg" width="200px" caption="A 3D render of the SOT-23 component package." >}}

The number of pins used not only depends on the required number of connections but also the desired thermal resistance (high-current SOT23 devices may use more than one pin for the same net to improve thermal performance). Used commonly for FETs transistors, diodes, and other components only having a small number of leads. SparkFun makes a [SOT-23 to DIP breakout board](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/717).

{{< img src="component-package-sot-23-6-sc-74a-sot-457-3d-render.jpg" width="200px" caption="A 3D render of the SOT-23-6 (SOT-457) component package."  >}}

The 3, 5, and 6 pin SOT-23 variants have the same pitch of 0.95mm, and all are compatible with the 6 pin footprint (which means you can use a SOT-23-6 adapter board for the 3 and 5 pin variants also).

JEDEC formalized the dimensions of the SOT-23 package (and all it's variants) in the MO-178 document (with package designator `R-PDSO-G`). After registering, you can download this document for free from (https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/mo-178-c)[https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/mo-178-c].

## What Is The Difference Between TO-236AA And TO-236AB?

Both `TO-236AA` and `TO-236AB` are official JEDEC names for the SOT-23-3 package. An image comment on Wikipedia[^wikipedia-inductiveload] states that the `TO-236AB` package is approximately 0.1mm higher. However it is hard to verify this claim by comparing manufacturer package dimensions, as 0.1mm is well with the manufacturing tolerances.

## SOT-23-3

The `SOT-23-6` has a pitch of 0.95mm.

**Dimensions**

{{< img src="package-dimensions-sot23-3.gif" caption="The dimensions of the SOT-23-3 component package."  width="500px" >}}

## SOT-23-6

The `SOT-23-6` has a pitch of 0.95mm.

### Non-standard Pin Numbering

{{% warning %}}
The SOT-23-6 package by Rohm (a.k.a IMT4, SOT-457, SMT6) has non-standard, clockwise pin numbering starting at the top right pin.

Why you'd ever number the package in that manner is beyond me. It's dangerous, and bound to cause PCB designers to do board respins!


## SOT-23-8

**Dimensions**

{{< img src="sot-23-8-component-package-dimensions-diodes-incorporated.png" width="800px" caption="Dimensions for the SOT-23-8 component package. Image from http://www.diodes.com/." >}}

**Recommended Footprint**

{{% warning %}}
The `SOT-23-8` has a smaller pitch of 0.65mm compared to the `SOT-23-3`, `SOT-23-5`, and `SOT-23-6` which all have a pitch of 0.95mm. This is to fit the 4 pins on each side, the original `SOT-23` design (which is a synonym for `SOT-23-3`) only had room for a maximum of 3 pins per side.
