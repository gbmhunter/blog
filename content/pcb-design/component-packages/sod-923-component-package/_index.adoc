## SOD-923 (Gull-wing Lead Variant)

The SOD-923 is similar to the SOD-923F, except the SOD-923 has pins protruding from the sides of the package and is not considered a "chip" package. The SOD-923 and SOD-923F have the same outer dimensions (when you include the pins in the SOD-923).

## SOD-923F (Flat Lead Variant)

The SOD-923F is similar to the link:../sod-923-component-package[SOD-923], except that the SOD-923F does not have pins protruding past the end of the package and instead is a "chip" style package with the pins on the bottom face of the package. It is identical to the 0402 package commonly used for resistors and capacitor, however the `SOD-923F`` designation is typically used for diodes whilst `0402` is used for chip resistors and capacitors.
