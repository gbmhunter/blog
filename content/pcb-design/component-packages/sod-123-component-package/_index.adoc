## SOD-123

The _SOD-123_ component package is a small, 2-lead SMD package, commonly used for packaging diodes. The leads are gull-wing style (coming out the side of the package), whilst the `SOD-123F` variant has pads (on the underside of the package).

### Dimensions And Recommended Footprint

.Dimensions and a recommended footprint (land pattern) for the SOD-123 component package.

Note that the pins in the above diagram are labelled with the diode anode being pin 2, and the cathode being pin 1. This is not what I would consider to be intuitive numbering!

## SOD-123F

The SOD-123F component package has narrow, flat leads protruding from the base of the SMD package.

Synonyms:

* DO-219AA
* PDMU (Rohm)
* M1F (Fagor Electronica)

Pitch: 2.8mm

Recommended Footprint = 4.4x2.1mm = 9.2mm2

## SOD-123EP

The `SOD-123EP` is a variant of the `SOD-123` package with one of the pads being extended further underneath the package for improved power dissipation. This package is typically used for diodes, with the cathode connected to the larger pad<<bib-onsemi-ss12fp-ds>>. Known as `CASE 425AC` by On Semi<<bib-onsemi-ss12fp-ds>>.

## SOD-123W

Synonyms:

* CFP3 (Nexperia)<<bib-nexperia-pmeg60t20elr-ds>>
* SOD-123W-2 (Mouser)<<bib-mouser-diodes-sod-123w-2>>

Dimensions<<bib-nexperia-pmeg60t20elr-ds>>:

* Length: 3.5mm
* Width: 1.7mm
* Height: 1.0mm 

The above dimensions are nominal and include the leads (i.e. outer dimensions). This package the same nominal outer dimensions as the SOD-123F and SOD-123EP variants.
