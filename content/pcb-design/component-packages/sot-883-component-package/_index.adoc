The `SOT-883` component package is very similar to a DFN package. It is also very similar to the link:/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-882-component-package/[SOD-882 component package] (note: that's `SOD`, not `SOT`!). It has the same outside dimensions as the `SOD-882`, except with the addition of an extra pad. This presumably explains the transition from `SOD` to `SOT` -- the two pin package is used for diodes, whilst this three pin package is used for transistors.

onsemi (formally On Semiconductor) calls this package the `XDFN3`<<bib-on-semi-ntns3c68nz-ds>>. However, you have to be careful as onsemi also uses the name `XDFN3` for slightly different packages, for example, the NTNS5K0P021Z MOSFET, which has a smaller package size of 0.62x0.42x0.4mm<<bib-on-semi-ntns5k0p021z-ds>>, rather than 1.0x0.6x0.5mm of the `SOT-883`. The key difference is the "case code" which is `CASE 506CB1`<<bib-on-semi-ntns3c68nz-ds>> for the SOT-883, but `CASE 711BH`<<bib-on-semi-ntns5k0p021z-ds>> for the smaller 0.62x0.42x0.4mm package.
