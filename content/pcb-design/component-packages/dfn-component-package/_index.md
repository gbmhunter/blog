You can solder the exposed pad in some cases by drilling a hole in the centre of the pad and soldering from the underside.</td>

The `DFN` (_Dual Flat No-lead_) component package is also commonly known as the `SON` package. TI also calls this the _Plastic Small Outline No-lead_ package.

The `DFN` package is very closely related to the `QFN` package. **From what I can tell, the main difference between the DFN and QFN package is that the `DFN` package generally only has pins running down two of it's sides, while a `QFN` package has pins on all four sides.** However, this is not a hard-and-fast rule, for example the `V-DFN3020-13 (Type A)` package by Diodes Inc. has pins on three of four sides[^bib-diodes-inc-ap63356]. The other big difference I have seen is that QFN packages seem to more standardized with consistent pin/package shapes and dimensions, whilst packages labelled "DFN" can have all sorts of "weird" pad/package geometries (see the below image).

JEDEC standard `JESD75-5` specifies how generic logic circuits will be connected to certain pins of the DFN package.

Below is an "odd shaped" SON package used by Numonyx flash chips that goes under the name VDFPN8. Notice the half-round appearance of the pins.

[Texas Instruments AN-1187: Leadless Leadframe Package (LLP)](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snoa401r/snoa401r.pdf) is a great PCB designers reference document when using DFN or QFN packages (the document calls them LLP, but it is the same thing as DFN/QFN).

## Thermal Pad

The SON package has a exposed thermal pad on the underside, similar to a QFN package.

For a comparable TQFP package with the same pin count, the SON package (with an exposed pad) can usually handle more than twice the power dissipation.

## DFN-6, 3x3mm

The DFN-6 3x3mm package is used for components such as MOSFETs.

{{% figure src="son-6-component-package-with-two-thermal-pads.jpg" width="300px" caption="The 3D model of the DFN-6 component package which has two thermal pads instead of one." %}}

## DFN-8, 3x3mm

The DFN-8 3x3mm package is used for components such as linear regulators[^bib-st-ldk715-ds].

## WSON And VSON Variants

The WSON and VSON variants of the SON package are identical to the SON package except for varying heights.

The WSON variant has a height of 0.80mm (max.)

The VSON variant has a height of 1.00mm (max.)
