* The page on {{% link text="Electronic Noise And EMI Suppression" src="/electronics/circuit-design/noise-and-emi-suppression" %}} moved from Electronics->Test And Measurement to Electronics->Circuit Design.

* Renamed the Fast Fourier Transform page to the {{% link text="Fourier Transform page" src="/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms" %}}, as it now contains information about other Fourier transforms.

* Added graphs of 1D Fourier transformations:

    {{% figure src="/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms/1d-fourier-transform.png" %}}

    and animated .gifs of 2D Fourier transformations:

    {{% figure src="/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms/sinusoidal.gif" %}}

* Updated the pytest page with info on `mark` (markers) and `pytest` naming conventions.

* Removed the `updates` directory that all monthly update posts were under.

* Added a {{% link text="tutorial on pandas" src="/programming/languages/python/pandas" %}}, a popular data analytics library for Python.

    {{% img src="pandas_logo.png" width="700px" caption="The pandas logo." %}}

* Updated the {{% link text="Python Debugging page" src="/programming/languages/python/python-debugging" %}} with more info on `pdb`.

* Updated the {{% link text="Filters page" src="/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters" %}} with more information on low-pass RC filters, including plots of the frequency response:

    {{% figure src="/electronics/circuit-design/filters/passive-filters/rc-low-pass-filter-frequency-response.png" width="500px" %}}

* I created a public mbedded.ninja project on CircuitMaker at [https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/GeoffreyHunter/mbedded-ninja](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/GeoffreyHunter/mbedded-ninja). I am going to trial out CircuitMaker as a tool for drawing schematic diagrams for this blog. In the past I have used Altium (not free), MultisimLive and InkScape (free but is a general vector graphics editor, not a dedicated electronics CAD program).

* Added the {{% link text="Command-Line CSV Viewer page" src="/programming/operating-systems/linux/command-line-csv-viewer" %}}, which contains information on how to cleanly view CSV files from the Linux command-line.

* Added a {{% link text="new page about the programming language Julia" src="/programming/languages/julia" %}}.
