* The {{% link text="Component Schematic Symbols and Designators page" src="/electronics/circuit-design/component-schematic-symbols-and-designators" %}} was updated. The mobile unfriendly one-big-table design was removed in favour of separate sections for each component and designator/schematic symbol. Some of the symbols were also updated using InkScape.

* The PCB Design Tools section of the main PCB Design page was moved onto it's own {{% link text="PCB Design Tools page" src="/pcb-design/pcb-design-tools" %}}.

* All section on the main PCB Design page regarding PCB layers were moved into their own new {{% link text="PCB Layers page" src="/pcb-design/pcb-layers" %}}.

* Big updates to the {{% link text="Convolution page" src="/programming/signal-processing/convolution" %}}, including the addition of a worked example where the convolution of two box-car functions is calculated.

    {{% figure src="convolution-two-box-car-functions.gif" width="500px" caption="An animated .gif showing the convolution of two box-car functions. The value of the convolution function at any time t (bottom line in red) is the amount area shown in red in the middle plot, which is the area under the curve of f(t)g(t) (the two waveforms multiplied together)." %}}

* Added a new page on {{% link text="less" src="/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/less" %}}, the basic Linux command-line utility for displaying text.

* Added a new {{% link text="Image Processing subsection" src="/programming/signal-processing/image-processing" %}} under Programming->Signal Processing. Added a new {{% link text="Morphology page" src="/programming/signal-processing/image-processing/morphology" %}} under the Image Processing section.

* Addition of information on `git commit --fixup` and `git log` to the {{% link text="git page" src="/programming/version-control-systems/git" %}}.

* Addition of ownership (`chown`) information to the {{% link text="Users, Groups, And Permissions In Linux page" src="/programming/operating-systems/linux/users-groups-and-permissions-in-linux" %}}.

* Added a `LICENSE.txt` (containing the MIT license) to many of my Git repos, including:
