I have recently upgraded this sites theme from [Avada](http://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226) to [Twenty Fifteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/).

I purchased the **Avada** theme for US$58 a few months ago, mainly because I was looking to "get with the cool kids" and start using a **responsive** theme that would looks good on both phones and tablets as well as the standard computer screen. I specifically went with Avada because it was the most popular paid for theme on ThemeForest (I was a sheep in that regard).




However, I soon became pretty **disappointed with Avada**. The built-in defaults were not that good at all, and when it came to tweaking it (with a child theme of course) everything turned into a nightmare because of the theme's complicated, deeply nested and non-intuitive folder structure., along with it's complicated PHP files which are riddled with very specific, nested if/else if/else statements.




Attempting to change anything ended up taking 5x as long as it really should of. After a few months of wrestling with the Avada monster I decided it was time to go simple.




The [**Twenty Fifteen** theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/) (the default Wordpress theme in 2015) offered me the simplicity I needed. Apart from looking great out of the box, it has been simple (so far) to add and modify a child theme for it.




The folder structure is simple, and the added features both powerful and good looking but well integrated. The biggest issue I will have with converting will be trying to fit wide elements onto the relatively narrow (approx. 630px) post-content space, when viewing on a computer screen. This includes some of the bigger calculators such as the PCB Track Current Capability (IPC-2152) calculator (as of Dec 2017, this calculator has moved to [http://ninja-calc.mbedded.ninja/](http://ninja-calc.mbedded.ninja/)).
