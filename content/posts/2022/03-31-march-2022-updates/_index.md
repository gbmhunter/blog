* Added more info to the [MiniMELF Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/mini-melf-sod-80-do-213aa-component-package/).
    {{% figure src="minimelf-screenshot.png" width="500px" caption="" %}}

* Added info on [average rectified forward current for general purpose diodes](/electronics/components/diodes/general-purpose-diodes/#_average_rectified_forward_current).
    {{% figure src="average-rectified-forward-current-screenshot.png" width="500px" caption="" %}}

* Added info on the ARIES Correct-A-Chip series of breakout boards/IC adapter PCBs.
    {{% figure src="aries-correct-a-chip-screenshot.png" width="500px" caption="" %}} 

* Added info on adding a [high-value parallel feedback resistor to 32.678kHz crystal tracks](/electronics/components/crystals-and-oscillators/#_32_768khz_crystal_start_up_issues) to prevent start-up problems in humid environments.

* Added info on adding [pull-up resistors to UART TX/RX lines to prevent spurious garbage being transmitted during microcontroller resets](/electronics/communication-protocols/uart-communication-protocol/#_pull_up_resistors_on_tx_lines).
    {{% figure src="pullup-on-uart-tx-screenshot.png" width="500px" caption="" %}}

* Added more info on [voltage-level translator ICs](/electronics/components/voltage-level-translation/).
    {{% figure src="voltage-level-translation-screenshot.png" width="500px" caption="" %}}

* Added info on [CMOS totem-pole drivers with added power off protection](/electronics/circuit-design/logic-families/#_powered_off_protection).
    {{% figure src="cmos-powered-off-protection-screenshot.png" width="500px" caption="" %}}

* Updated the info on the [SOD-523 Component Package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-523-component-package/).
