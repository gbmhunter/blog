* Added [real world EMC measurements to the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) page](/electronics/electromagnetic-compatibility-emc/#interesting-real-world-emc-measurements).
    {{% figure src="real-world-emc-screenshot.png" width="500px" %}}

* Added a new page on the [HU3PAK Component Package](/pcb-design/component-packages/hu3pak-component-package/).
    {{% figure src="hu3pak-screenshot.png" width="500px" %}}

* Added the new page [Running Rust on Microcontrollers](/programming/languages/rust/running-rust-on-microcontrollers/).
    {{% figure src="embedded-rust-screenshot.png" width="500px" %}}

* Changed the code block theme from `rainbow_dash` (light theme) to `monokai` (dark theme) as I feel as it's easier to read.

* Added info on the [CAN-FD (CAN with flexible data-rate) standard](/electronics/communication-protocols/can-protocol/#can-fd).

* Converted the [Capacitors page](/electronics/components/capacitors/) from Asciidoc to Markdown format, and added new image with various capacitor schematic symbols (incl. the Japanese-style symbol).
