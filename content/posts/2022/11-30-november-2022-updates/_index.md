## Updates This Month

* Added real world EMC measurements.

* Added a new page on the [HU3PAK Component Package](/pcb-design/component-packages/hu3pak-component-package/).

* Added the new page [Running Rust on Microcontrollers](/programming/languages/rust/running-rust-on-microcontrollers/).

* Changed the code block theme from `rainbow_dash` (light theme) to `monokai` (dark theme) as I feel as it's easier to read.
