- Started the upgrade from CSS to SCSS (using hugo-extended).
- Started migrating from Markdown to AsciiDoc (using AsciiDoctor support provided by Hugo).
- Settled on a colour scheme for drawing diagrams (using LibreOffice Draw).
- Upgraded the main menu from hover style interface to an accordian style interface, making it more user friendly for people using touchscreen devices.
- Upgraded the base layout of every page to use Bootstrap responsive columns, rather than my own custom CSS to achieve the same level of responsiveness.
