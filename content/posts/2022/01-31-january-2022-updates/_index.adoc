== Updates This Month

* Added info on ICs which have different part numbers for different I2C addresses.

* Added a photo of a castellated daughter board inside a Logitech G810 mechanical keyboard. 

* Created a new page on link:/electronics/components/current-sources-and-sinks/[current sources and sinks], including a Zener/BJT current source and constant-current diode (JFET current source).

* Added link:/electronics/components/transistors/junction-gate-field-effect-transistor-jfets/[JFET schematic symbols]. Added JFET info on link:/electronics/components/transistors/junction-gate-field-effect-transistor-jfets/[transconductance and dynamic resistance].

* Created a new page on link:/electronics/circuit-design/wheatstone-bridges/[Wheatstone bridges].

* Condensed all the temperature sensor sub-pages into the temperature sensor page.

* Added more info on the SOIC component package.

* Added a page on termination (electrical termination of transmission lines), including schematic examples of series termination. 

* Added more info on the SOIC component package, including the link:/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-162-1-component-package/[SOT-162-1 NXP synonym].

* Added info on the link:/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-123-component-package/#_sod_123ep[SOD-123EP component package], a variant of the SOD-123.

* Added info on link:/programming/design-patterns/how-to-write-super-loops-in-firmware/#_keeping_track_of_loop_time[monitoring loop time] to the page on firmware superloops.
