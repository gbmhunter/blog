* Added info on [ICs which have different part numbers for different I2C addresses]().
    {{% figure src="i2c-addresses-diff-part-nums-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Added a [/pcb-design/castellation/photo of a castellated daughter board inside a Logitech G810 mechanical keyboard](). 
    {{% figure src="logitech-castellation-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Created a new page on [current sources and sinks](/electronics/components/current-sources-and-sinks/), including a Zener/BJT current source and constant-current diode (JFET current source).
    {{% figure src="current-sources-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Added [JFET schematic symbols](/electronics/components/transistors/junction-gate-field-effect-transistor-jfets/). Added JFET info on [transconductance and dynamic resistance](/electronics/components/transistors/junction-gate-field-effect-transistor-jfets/).

* Created a new page on [Wheatstone bridges](/electronics/circuit-design/wheatstone-bridges/).
    {{% figure src="wheatstone-bridges-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Condensed all the temperature sensor sub-pages into the [temperature sensor page](/electronics/components/sensors/temperature-sensors/).
    {{% figure src="temperature-sensors-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Added a page on [termination (electrical termination of transmission lines), including schematic examples of series termination](/electronics/circuit-design/transmission-lines/termination/). 
    {{% figure src="series-termination-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Added more info on the SOIC component package, including the [SOT-162-1 NXP synonym](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-162-1-component-package/).
    {{% figure src="soic-component-package-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Added info on the [SOD-123EP component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-123-component-package/#_sod_123ep), a variant of the SOD-123.
    {{% figure src="sod-123ep-component-package-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Added info on [monitoring loop time](/programming/design-patterns/how-to-write-super-loops-in-firmware/#_keeping_track_of_loop_time) to the page on firmware superloops.
