## Updates This Month

* Added information on [MQTT message ordering](/electronics/communication-protocols/mqtt-protocol/#message-ordering).
    {{% figure src="mqtt-message-ordering-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added [standard max. and min. resistances for E series resistors](/electronics/components/resistors/#the-e-series).
    {{% figure src="e-series-min-max-values-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added info on [BJT leakage currents](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts/#bjt-leakage-currents).
    {{% figure src="bjt-leakage-currents-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added a `file` shortcode to load content from relative files into the main Markdown file. This is used to load a Python generated HTML table (which is saved to a separate file) into the primary Markdown file.

* Added info on [circuit breaker ICs](/electronics/circuit-design/load-switches/).

* Added more info on [filter tunings](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/filter-tunings/) including Chebyshev equations and plots, Bessel filter tunings, using the sympy Python package to generate tables of factored Butterworth filter polynomials, equations to find the normalized Butterworth tuning (filters) polynomials, bode plots of various order Butterworth tunings.

* Added more info to the [What Are Transfer Functions, Poles, And Zeroes?](/electronics/circuit-design/what-are-transfer-functions-poles-and-zeroes/) page, including Laplace transformations, info on Wolfram Alpha's ability to analyze transfer functions.

* Added info on the popular S8050 NPN BJT to the [Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT) page](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts/#s8050).
    {{% figure src="s8050-bjt-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added a [new page](/programming/languages/c/the-confusing-differences-between-struct-and-typedef-struct/) on the differences between using struct and typedef struct in the C programming language.
