## Updates This Month

* Used the sympy Python package to generate tables of factored Butterworth filter polynomials.

* Added information on [MQTT message ordering](/electronics/communication-protocols/mqtt-protocol/#message-ordering).

* Added [standard max. and min. resistances for E series resistors](/electronics/components/resistors/#the-e-series).

* Added info on [BJT leakage currents](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts/#bjt-leakage-currents).

* Added [equations to find the normalized Butterworth tuning (filters) polynomials](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/filter-tunings/). Added bode plots of various order Butterworth tunings.

* Added a `file` shortcode to load content from relative files into the main Markdown file. This is used to load a Python generated HTML table (which is saved to a separate file) into the primary Markdown file.

* Added info on [circuit breaker ICs](/electronics/circuit-design/load-switches/).

* Added info on [Chebyshev filter tunings](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/filter-tunings/) including equations and plots.
