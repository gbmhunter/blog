## Updates This Month

* Updated the PID page.

* Added [more info on SMA filters](/programming/signal-processing/digital-filters/moving-average-filters/), including the recursive SMA algorithm and plots showing SMA filters working on noisy data. Also moved info on moving average filters onto it's own page.

* Added [info on the impulse response of a IIR EMA filter](/programming/signal-processing/digital-filters/exponential-moving-average-ema-filter/).
