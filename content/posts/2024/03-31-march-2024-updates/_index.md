Released a new version of NinjaTerm, `v4.13.0` which adds smart copy/paste support with `Ctrl-Shift-C/V`.

Started using Umami Analytics for analytics alongside Google Analytics. Umami is self-hosted on a Amazon Lightsail instance. The subdomain `umami.mbedded.ninja` points to the IPv6 only instance. If Umami works well, Google Analytics will be removed in the following months.

Added a new page on how to [setup Umami Analytics on Amazon Lightsail](/programming/website-design/running-umami-on-aws-lightsail/).
