## Statistics for 2023

2022 saw 384k (384,000) page views! This was up from 267k last year, an increase of 117k or 44%.

At the end of 2022 the site had 604k words, up from 536k words last year (an increase of 68k). These words were spread over 1168 pages, and included 4,319 images (and increase of 330 from 3989 images last year).

### Most Popular Pages

The top 10 most popular pages, ranked by number of page views:

_Programming_ related pages took the top spots of 1, 2, 3 and 5 (num. 4 was the homepage), with the first _electronics_ related pages coming in at positions 6, 8 and 9.

### Acquisition

As usual, most of the traffic was from organic search (e.g. Google search engine).

### Donations

In 2022 I added a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/gbmhunter) donation button. I wasn't expecting much (if anything), but some kind person donated $30 last year. I'll celebrate that!

## Achievements in 2023

* Asciidoc pages have been fully phased out.
* Finally, the end of the year saw the blog get a dark mode!

## Plans For The 2024 Year

* **More content, and improving existing content**: As always!
* **Add the ability to do a site wide search**: I'm thinking I'll use pageview for this.
