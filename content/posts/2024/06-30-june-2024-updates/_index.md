You now have the ability to send a break signal at the end of every line in a hex macro. This was another feature request by a user.

I added a page to this blog on how to [choose serial numbers for embedded devices](/programming/firmware/choosing-serial-numbers-for-embedded-products/). It shows the way to calculate the mathematical probability of a collision when using random numbers for serial numbers.
