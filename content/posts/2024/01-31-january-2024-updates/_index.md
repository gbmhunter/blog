* Added info on the [Law of Cosines](/mathematics/geometry/triangles/#law-of-cosines).

* Added info on the [Trigonometric Ratios](/mathematics/geometry/triangles/#trigonometric-ratios).

* Added the ability to do a site-wide search with the help of the pagefind library. At compile time, after hugo builds the site, pagefind is then run and creates a search dictionary that is downloaded to the client when they want to perform a search. All the searching happens client-side, no server is needed.
