* New [Premade Recipes page](/programming/embedded-linux/yocto-project/premade-recipes) under Programming->Embedded Linux->Yocto.  

* Updated the [Python SWIG Bindings From C++ page](/programming/languages/python/python-swig-bindings-from-cplusplus) with a tutorial on how to pass (and call) callbacks from Python code to C++ code, and information on custom typemaps and typechecks (with working code examples).
