Here's the updates for this month! However, the thing that shadows all these points is the move to a new domain, more on that soon!

* Added Op-Amp banner.

* Moved the Control Methodology from under Programming->Languages->C to Programming->General, as it now contains information applicable to all programming languages.

* New page, {{% link text="Abstraction Layers" src="/programming/design-patterns/abstraction-layers" %}} under Programming->Methodologies. Added an example of an abstraction layer for a operating system (OSAL), and for microcontroller hardware peripherals such as GPIO and UART.

* Updates to repo [RingBuffCpp](https://github.com/gbmhunter/RingBuffCpp).

* Creation of new GitHub repo [MStringCpp](https://github.com/gbmhunter/MStringCpp).

* Moved content on OpenCart page to {{% link text="OpenCart->General" src="/programming/website-design/opencart/general" %}}.

* Added info to the {{% link text="OpenCart->General page" src="/programming/website-design/opencart/general" %}} on how to disable vqmod logging.

* Updated the {{% link text="Electrical Supplier page" src="/electronics/general/electrical-suppliers" %}} with info about Samtec and fixed some of the formatting issues on the page. Fixed some external links on this page.

* New page, {{% link text="C++->Operator Overloading" src="/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/operator-overloading" %}} which explains how to perform operator overloading in C++.

* New page Electronics->Communication Protocols->{{% link text="AT Protocol" src="/electronics/communication-protocols/at-protocol" %}}.

* PSoC USB pins can be used as GPIO, but only when the drive mode is in one of two configurations. Info added to the {{% link text="pins section of the PSoC Components page" src="/programming/microcontrollers/psoc/components#pins" %}}.

* Moved all GitHub repos from user gbmhunter to new organisation ~~[mbedded-ninja](https://github.com/mbedded-ninja)~~.
