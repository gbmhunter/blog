It was only when I viewed my website from another person's computer that I realised that the [disqus commenting system](http://www.disqus.com/) was adding ads (an "Around The Web" section) to the bottom of this site's pages. I have a strong aversion to ads (especially IRRELEVANT ones like disqus was adding), even though they could potentially earn me money (I had earnt around US$12 so far, sarcastic yay!).

After looking through the disqus setting on this site, I discovered that I had to remove them through the admin panel on [www.disqus.com](http://www.disqus.com).

Now we are back to normal!
