* Added a new Oscilloscopes page.

* Added a new Test Leads And Probes page.

* Added {{% link text="schematics, explanations and equations" src="/electronics/circuit-design/power-management/load-switches" %}} for a P-channel load switch which is turned on by a BJT current-sink.

    {{% figure src="/electronics/circuit-design/power-management/load-switches/bjt-current-source-to-turn-p-channel-on.svg" width="500px" %}}

* Updated the schematic symbols on the {{% link text="BJT Transistors page" src="/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts" %}}.

* Added an example of a common-base amplifier to the BJT Transistors page.

* Added more info on quiescent currents and slew rates to the op-amp page.
