== Updates This Month

* Added a link:/electronics/components/analogue-switches/["How They Work" section] to the Analogue Switches page, including a circuit diagram.

* Added a new page with info on the link:/pcb-design/component-packages/sc-89-component-package/[SC-89 component package].

* Added a model of the input offset voltage for op-amps, a schematic for external input offset voltage trimming, and info on input offset voltage drift with both temperature and time to the link:/electronics/components/op-amps/[Op-Amps page].

* Added new page called link:/electronics/circuit-design/what-are-transfer-functions-poles-and-zeroes/[What Are Transfer Functions, Poles, And Zeroes?].

* Add the tutorial: link:/programming/cloud/aws/creating-a-scheduled-lambda-function-using-aws-cdk/[Creating A Scheduled Lambda Function Using AWS CDK].

* Added a new page on link:/pcb-design/component-packages/smd-crystal-packages/[SMD Crystal Packages].

* Added info on the link:/electronics/components/crystals-and-oscillators/#_32_678khz_crystals[turnover temperature and oscillation mode of 32.768kHz crystals and the negative resistance test].

* Added info on link:/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/logic-gates/[RTL and SR latches] to the Logic Gates page.

* Added info on link:/electronics/components/op-amps/#_summing_amplifier[summing amplifiers to the Op-Amps page].

* Added link:/electronics/components/op-amps/#_level_shifters[info, schematics and simulation results] for op-amp based level-shifters.

* Condensed the four battery pages (lead-acid, zinc-air, coin cells, lithium thionyl chloride) into a single Batteries page.
