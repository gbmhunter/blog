* Added a ["How They Work" section](/electronics/components/analogue-switches/) to the Analogue Switches page, including a circuit diagram.
    {{% figure src="/posts/2021/09-30-september-2021-updates/analogue-switch-screenshot.png" width="500px" caption="" %}}

* Added a new page with info on the [SC-89 component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sc-89-component-package/).

* Added a model of the input offset voltage for op-amps, a schematic for external input offset voltage trimming, and info on input offset voltage drift with both temperature and time to the [Op-Amps page](/electronics/components/op-amps/).

* Added new page called [What Are Transfer Functions, Poles, And Zeroes?](/electronics/circuit-design/what-are-transfer-functions-poles-and-zeroes/).

* Add the tutorial: [Creating A Scheduled Lambda Function Using AWS CDK](/programming/cloud/aws/creating-a-scheduled-lambda-function-using-aws-cdk/).

* Added a new page on [SMD Crystal Packages](/pcb-design/component-packages/smd-crystal-packages/).

* Added info on the [turnover temperature and oscillation mode of 32.768kHz crystals and the negative resistance test](/electronics/components/crystals-and-oscillators/#_32_678khz_crystals).

* Added info on [summing amplifiers to the Op-Amps page](/electronics/components/op-amps/#_summing_amplifier).
    {{% figure src="/posts/2021/09-30-september-2021-updates/non-inverting-summing-amplifier-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Added [info, schematics and simulation results](/electronics/components/op-amps/#_level_shifters) for op-amp based level-shifters.
    {{% figure src="/posts/2021/09-30-september-2021-updates/op-amp-level-shifter-screenshot.png" width="400px" caption="" %}}

* Condensed the four battery pages (lead-acid, zinc-air, coin cells, lithium thionyl chloride) into a [single Batteries page](/electronics/components/batteries/).

* Condensed the diode pages (TVS diodes, LEDs, Zener Diodes, General Purpose Diodes) into a [single page](/electronics/components/diodes/).

* Added info, schematics and equations for [op-amp based ideal diodes and half-wave rectifiers](/electronics/components/op-amps/#_ideal_diodesrectifiers).
