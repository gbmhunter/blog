* Added a new page (in notes format) on [Spark Gaps](/electronics/components/spark-gaps/).

* Added info on [transient surge waveform specification](/electronics/circuit-design/esd-protection/#_lighting_surge_characterization_and_test_transient_pulses), including a graph illustration the concept behind 8/20us and similar specifications:

* Moved Zener diode info into it's [own page](/electronics/components/diodes/zener-diodes/).

* Cleaned up many of the schematic symbols on this site for a consistent look and feel.

* Added a diagram showing the protection diodes common to most digital CMOS pins.
