== Updates This Month

* A new page on link:/mathematics/statistics/probabilities/[Probabilities]. Added info on it about how to generate random numbers that follow a specific distribution.

* Consolidated all the info on non-isolated switch-mode power supplies (e.g. buck converters, boost converters, buck-boost, SEPIC, Ä†uk) into a link:/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/[single page]. And then added more info, as well as updating the basic schematics of the various topologies to match this site's style.

* Added info on MQTT clients suitable for embedded devices.

* Expanded the TOC to contain heading levels 2 to 4 (beforehand it was only showing level 2).

* Added the ability to define multiple authors per page, and added an author block to all content pages. Followed a really useful tutorial at https://moonbooth.com/hugo/authors/.

* Added a link:/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts/#_the_bjt_safe_operating_area[safe operating area (SOA)] graph to the BJT page, and added information on secondary breakdown.

* Added link:/electronics/components/power-regulators/linear-regulators/#_protection[info and schematics on adding protection diodes to linear regulators].
