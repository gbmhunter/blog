* Merged the Oscillators and Crystal pages (which were grouped under a section called _Timing_) into the single [Oscillators page](/electronics/components/oscillators).

* Added information on MEMS Oscillators to the [Oscillators page](/electronics/components/oscillators) and [Chip Package](/pcb-design/component-packages/chip-eia-component-packages) pages.

* Added a [Components That Don't Like Ultrasonic Baths section to the Ultrasonic Cleaners page](/electronics/tools/ultrasonic-cleaners#components-that-dont-like-ultrasonic-baths).

* Added a new page on [Common-mode Chokes](/electronics/components/common-mode-chokes).
    {{% figure src="common-mode-choke-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added a section on [IDC Connectors to the Connector page](/electronics/components/connectors#idc-connectors).

* Add a new page (currently in notes form) on [Small-Signal Analysis](/electronics/circuit-design/small-signal-analysis).

* Added more information about [potentiometers to the Resistors page](/electronics/components/resistors#potentiometers-and-rheostats-variable-resistors).
    {{% figure src="potentiometers-screenshot.png" width="500px" %}}

* Added a new page on [Shunt Regulators](/electronics/components/power-regulators/shunt-regulators)
    {{% figure src="shunt-regulators-screenshot.png" width="500px" %}}

* Added a new page on [Multiplexers And Demultiplexers](/electronics/components/multiplexers-and-demultiplexers).
    {{% figure src="multiplexers-screenshot.png" width="500px" %}}

* Added info on the [KiCad Tips And Tricks page](/electronics/general/kicad/kicad-tips-and-tricks) on how to create resistor and Zener simulation components.
