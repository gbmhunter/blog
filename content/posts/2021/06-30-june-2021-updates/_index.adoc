== Updates This Month

* Combined the "Passing A C{plus}{plus} Member Function To A C Callback" page into the "C{plus}{plus} Callbacks" page. Updated the page with much more info, including worked examples which use https://replit.com/@gbmhunter for hosting, compiling and running small snippets of C++ code.

* Updated the link:/electronics/circuit-design/electrical-noise/[Electrical Noise page] with info on the various "Colours of Noise" including graphs (in both the time and frequency domains) of white, pink, red, and blue noise.

* Starting testing the Asciidoc format and comparing it against the Markdown format.

* Added schematics, equations, worked examples, and bode plots on link:/electronics/components/capacitors/#_capacitance_multipliers[Capacitance Multiplier circuits].

* Removed the "Test And Measurement" section of the site. Moved the only page underneath it (the "Current Probes" page) to under "Tools" instead.

* Added a new page on link:/electronics/tools/ac-dc-electronic-loads[AC/DC Electronic Loads].

* Added a new page on link:/electronics/tools/line-impedance-stabilization-networks-lisn[Line Impedance Stabilization Networks (LISNs)].
