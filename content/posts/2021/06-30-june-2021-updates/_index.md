* Combined the "Passing A C++ Member Function To A C Callback" page into the "C++ Callbacks" page. Updated the page with much more info, including worked examples which use [https://replit.com/@gbmhunter](https://replit.com/@gbmhunter) for hosting, compiling and running small snippets of C++ code.

* Updated the Electrical Noise page with info on the various "Colours of Noise" including graphs (in both the time and frequency domains) of white, pink, red, and blue noise.

* Added info on {{% link text="Hakko soldering tweezers" src="/electronics/tools/soldering-irons-and-stations/#hakko-fm203-15" %}} to the Soldering Irons And Stations page.
