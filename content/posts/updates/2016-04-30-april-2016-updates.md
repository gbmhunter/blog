* Added information about [multiple-collector and multiple-emitter BJTs](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts#multiple-collector-and-multiple-emitter-bjts).  

	{{< figure src="/images/2015/08/basic-two-input-tll-nand-gate-schematic.png" width="499px" caption="The schematic of a basic two-input TTL NAND gate."  >}}  

* Information added on using low-pass RC filters for making a VDAC from a PWM source.
* Added information about the [10-bit I2C addressing scheme](/electronics/communication-protocols/i2c-protocol).
* New [How To Calculate Track Current page](/pcb-design/how-to-calculate-maximum-track-current) under the PCB Design section of the website, with information, equations, and more info on how to calculate the maximum current a track (a.k.a. trace) on a PCB can take.
* New [NTC Thermistor Temperature Sensing page](/electronics/components/sensors/temperature-sensors/ntc-thermistors-temperature-sensors) with information on PTC and NTC thermistors, including how to connect them up to a microcontroller for temperature measurements.  

	{{< figure src="/images/2016/05/screenshot-of-ntc-thermistor-page.png" width="529px" caption="A screenshot of the NTC thermistor page."  >}}  

* New [MicroBlaze page](/programming/microcontrollers/microblaze) under Programming->Microcontrollers.
* New [Z-Wave page](/electronics/communication-protocols/z-wave) under Electronics->Communication Protocols.
* New information about the [common-collector BJT amplifier](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts#common-collector).
