So it's finally finished! Many long-nights and weekends were spent finishing it off to a standard I was happy with! The wiring took a decent amount of time near the end, due to the enclosure quickly filling up with PCBs, wires and connectors, all requiring to be added in the correct order.

It is very fun to ride! Easily passes bikes and handles well and higher speeds, owing to it's large wheels and stiff rubber pads for turning.

**Some Essential Stats:**

Top Speed: >40km/h (I haven't reached it yet)
Max Distance Between Charges: >15km (haven't tested this yet either!)

Total Man Hours To Complete: 551.2
Time From First Starting Project: 2-years
Total Money Spent:  NZ$3611

**And Time For Some Photos:**
