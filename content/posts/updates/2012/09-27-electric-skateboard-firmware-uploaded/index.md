The firmware has been made public and can be downloaded as a Mercurial repo on www.bitbucket.com from [https://bitbucket.org/gbmhunter/electric-skateboard-firmware](https://bitbucket.org/gbmhunter/proj-electricskateboardfirmware).

Note that this is quite a large repo, as it contains the most recent and old versions of code, which were for different platforms.

More information can be found on the [Electric Skateboard Firmware](/electronics/projects/electric-skateboard/electric-skateboard-firmware) page, under Electronics->Projects->[Electric Skateboard](/electronics/projects/electric-skateboard).
