All the info I recorded about 38PVC, a experimental rocket motor I was playing around with in 2007, has got it's [own page](/pyrotechnics/rocketry/projects/38pvc).

This motor got lucky enough to be attached to skateboard, and rocket-board was born.

And the rocket-board video can be found on YouTube.
