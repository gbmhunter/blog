If you ever need to control a BLDC motor, hit up [this page](/electronics/circuit-design/bldc-motor-control)! This newly added information is all about the different types of BLDC motor, how the windings and magnets are orientated, the different control methods and the different feedback variables.

It also has BLDC motor equations,

a schematic diagram for PSoC hardware,

and example code.
