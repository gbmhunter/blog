* Big updates to the [Algorithm Time Complexity page](/programming/algorithms-and-data-structures/algorithm-time-complexity/).

* Added new page on [Python sets](/programming/languages/python/sets/).

* All github.com/mbedded-ninja repos were moved to [github.com/gbmhunter](github.com/gbmhunter) and the mbedded-ninja organization on GitHub was deleted as it was not really serving any useful purpose.
