**And here are the visitors in 2017 by country:**

I think the biggest reason for the drop in visits (down 40%) in 2017 was due to the moving of [www.mbedded.ninja](http://www.mbedded.ninja) to [blog.mbedded.ninja](/). Even though www.mbedded.ninja was then setup to redirect to the new URL (you can click the above links if you don't believe me!), a significant drop in traffic was seen from this point onwards (I'm not that savvy on the details of SEO, but I guess it hurt the site's reputation). You can see the drop in the image below:

The total number of visits (ever) is now at 730k. Bring on 1 million!

**Some things I would like the improve on the blog in 2018:**

* Move more and more images away from using image plugins, and instead use the default media handler.
* Add more child page sections to pages, and make sure each child page has both an image and a intelligible description.
* Boost visitor count back up to it's former levels (or better!) by improving content and SEO.
* Fully retire the use of the [QuickLatex](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quicklatex/) plugin, using [MathJax-Latex](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/mathjax-latex/) plugin for latex rendering instead.
