* All image duplicates in `static/images/` were deleted. These duplicates were created back when the site was running on Wordpress due to it's image optimization strategies (creating a _pyramid_ of resolutions for the same image to best match the size of the image when it is rendered on a page).

* Addition of a `link` shortcode.

* Updates to many of the component package pages in the {{% link text="Component Package Database" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/_index.md" %}}.

* Addition of the {{% link text="TO-273AA Component Package page" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/to-273aa-component-package/index.md" %}}.

* Updates to the {{% link text="Convolution page" src="/programming/signal-processing/convolution/index.md" %}}, including the addition of a worked example showing the calculation of the convolution between two "box-car" signals.

* I posted a link to the {{% link text="A Comparison of Serialisation Formats page" src="/programming/serialization-formats/a-comparison-of-serialization-formats/index.md" %}} to the [/r/programming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/bhq9c5/how_to_use_socketcan_with_the_commandline_in_linux/). I got a decent amount of feedback which helped improve the page and fix mistakes.

* The addition of the "Categories" page to the main menu.
