There have been many updates this month!

* A new [Ultrasonic Sensors page.](/electronics/components/sensors/ultrasonic-sensors/)

* More [candy-calc](https://github.com/gbmhunter/candy-calc) and [eng-calc-js](https://github.com/gbmhunter/eng-calcs-js) updates (including a name change, it used to be called Js-EngCalcs).

* New ~~[Miller Effect page](/electronics/circuit-design/miller-effect)~~ (under Electronics->Circuit Design).

* Info on the Miller Effect and [Isolated Gate Drives](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/#isolated-gate-drives) to the [MOSFET page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/).

* New [Eclipse page](/programming/general/eclipse) under Programming->General Programming.

* New info on [ASCII character codes and text formatting](/programming/languages/bash/) on the [Bash page](/programming/languages/bash).

* New [MOSFET gate-drive graph](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/#dead-time) on the [MOSFETs page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/).  

      {{< figure src="/images/misc/two-mosfet-gate-drives-with-deadtime-graph-screenshot.png" caption="Screenshot of the MOSFET gate drive graph on the MOSFETs page."   >}}
      
* New [eng-graphs-js repo](https://github.com/gbmhunter/eng-graphs-js), which holds all the data/code for the graphs displayed in various places on this website.

* New section "[GUI Design](/electronics/general/altium/altium-scripting-and-using-the-api#gui-design)" on the [Altium Scripting page](/electronics/general/altium/altium-scripting-and-using-the-api).

* New section on [Photo-diodes (both PIN and avalanche)](/electronics/components/diodes#photo-diodes) on the [Diodes page](/electronics/components/diodes).

* New [Electrical Signal Types page](/electronics/circuit-design/electrical-signal-types) under Electronics->Circuit Design.

* New [Classes](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/classes), [References](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/references), and [Virtual Methods](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/virtual-methods) child pages on the [C++ page](/programming/languages/c-plus-plus).

* New [iNursery project page](/electronics/projects/inursery) under Electronics->Projects.
