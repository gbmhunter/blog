* Converted the Digital Logic page from Asciidoc to Markdown.

* Added more info on [latches and flip-flops](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/latches-and-flip-flops/), including more schematics, info on D-type and JK flip-flops, Micro-Cap simulations, setup/hold times, and metastability.

* Added info on [transmission gates](/electronics/components/analogue-switches-transmission-gates/#transmission-gates).

* Added info on [tristate inverters](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/gates/#tristate-cmos-inverter).
