* Converted the [Digital Logic page](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/) from Asciidoc to Markdown.

* Added more info on [latches and flip-flops](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/latches-and-flip-flops/), including more schematics, info on D-type and JK flip-flops, Micro-Cap simulations, setup/hold times, and metastability.

* Added info on [transmission gates](/electronics/components/analogue-switches-transmission-gates/#transmission-gates).
    {{% figure src="transmission-gates-screenshot.png" width="400px" %}}

* Added info on [tristate inverters](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/gates/#tristate-cmos-inverter).

* Added [info, schematics and interactive simulations on digital logic gates built from NMOS technology](/electronics/circuit-design/digital-logic/gates/#n-type-metal-oxide-semiconductor-nmos-logic).
