* blog.mbedded.ninja now has a dark mode. New CSS styling rules have been created to properly colour things when in dark mode, and a little JS script has been added to respond to the light/dark toggle button click and store the preference in the users local storage.

* The page structure got modified. I wanted to improve the main left navigation menu. So I created a top navbar for the site logo, name and light/dark mode toggle. And then the left column is dedicated purely to the navigation menu. The on hover styling has been improved, with a clear indication you can click the chevron to expand/collapse a sub-menu. The chevrons are now all aligned on the right of the menu rather than on the left.

* Updated the VMIN and VTIME information on [Linux Serial Ports Using C/C++](/programming/operating-systems/linux/linux-serial-ports-using-c-cpp/).

* Added info on converting a version string into numbers to the [C String Manipulation page](/programming/languages/c/string-manipulation/#converting-a-version-string-to-numbers). This page was also restructured to read better.

* Added info on the [Hardware Info Interface (including reset causes) to the Zephyr page](/programming/operating-systems/zephyr-project/#hardware-info).

* Added more info on Benchtop PSUs to the [Electronics Tools page](/electronics/tools/).

* Started a page on [Triangles](/mathematics/geometry/triangles/), and added information about the [Law of Sines](/mathematics/geometry/triangles/#law-of-sines) to it.
