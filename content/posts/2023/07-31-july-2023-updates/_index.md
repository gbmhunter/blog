* Updated the info on the [Debouncing page](/electronics/circuit-design/debouncing/).

* Added info/gif on [Ultrasonic Humidifiers](/electronics/components/sensors/ultrasonic-sensors/#ultrasonic-humidifiers) to the Ultrasonic Sensors page.

* Added a new page on [USB Power Delivery (PD)](/electronics/communication-protocols/usb-protocol/usb-power-delivery/).

* Added figure and table numbering functionality, along with the ability to reference the figures and tables from other parts of the content.

* Added more info on the [DC Bias Characteristic of multilayer chip capacitors (MLCCs)](/electronics/components/capacitors/#dc-bias-characteristic-1).

* Changed the references to _dielectric constant_ to _relative permittivity_, as the former term has been deprecated. 

* Added a "sticky" table of contents (TOC) to the right-hand side of content pages, with automatic highlighting of the section currently in the browsers viewport.

* Added a new page on the [SOT-353 Component Package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sod-353-component-package/) (which has the common synonyms SC-88A and SC-70-5).

* Added a new page on [Voltage Supervisors](/electronics/components/voltage-supervisors/).

* Added info on how [inductor orientation can have an effect on EMI](/electronics/electromagnetic-compatibility-emc/emc-design-guidelines/#inductor-polarity) to the EMC Design Guidelines page.

* Added info on how [return current in a reference plane follows the trace at high frequencies](/electronics/electromagnetic-compatibility-emc/emc-design-guidelines/#solid-reference-planes-under-traces) to the EMC Design Guidelines page. 

* Updated the [TO-252 Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-252-component-package/) with more info.

* Added more information on H-bridges and motor driver ICs to the [H-bridges page](/electronics/components/h-bridges/).
