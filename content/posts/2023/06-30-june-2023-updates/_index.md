* Added information about electrolyte leakage in electrolytic capacitors.

* Fixed bug which resulting in the embedded circuitjs iframe's from being displayed correctly (unsure of what was caused the problem to occur in the first place).

* Added info on differences between "solid" and "wet" tantalum capacitors.

* Added a new aside shortcode for Markdown and changed the styling of the asides (called admonitions in AsciiDoc) so that the title and icon are a top-bar rather than a side-bar (looks better when there is longer content in the aside).

* Added info on the TO-220-7 and TO-220-7C variants of the TO-220 component package family.
