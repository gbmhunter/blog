* Added information about [electrolyte leakage in electrolytic capacitors](/electronics/components/capacitors/#electrolyte-leakage).
    {{% figure src="electrolyte-leakage-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Fixed bug which resulting in the embedded circuitjs iframe's from being displayed correctly (unsure of what was caused the problem to occur in the first place).

* Added info on differences between ["solid" and "wet" tantalum capacitors](/electronics/components/capacitors/#solid-tantalum-capacitors).
    {{% figure src="solid-wet-tantalum-capacitor-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added a new `aside` shortcode for Markdown and changed the styling of the asides (called admonitions in AsciiDoc) so that the title and icon are a top-bar rather than a side-bar (looks better when there is longer content in the aside).
    {{% figure src="aside-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added info on the [TO-220-7 and TO-220-7C variants of the TO-220 component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-220-component-package/#to-220-7) family.
    {{% figure src="to-220-7-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added a new page on the [TO-206 component package family](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-206-component-package/).
    {{% figure src="to-206-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Fixed error where the `SOT-490` was incorrectly labelled as `SOD-490`.

* Added a new page on [Switching PSU Control Methodologies](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/control-methodologies/).
    {{% figure src="smps-control-modes-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added a new page on [Mid-Chip Solder Balls](/pcb-design/mid-chip-solder-balls/).
    {{% figure src="mid-chip-solder-balls-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added info on feedforward, standard form, series form, and diagrams to the [PID Control page](/programming/general/pid-control/).
    {{% figure src="pid-parallel-form-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added info on manual tuning to the [PID Control page](/programming/general/pid-control/), including a worked example.
    {{% figure src="pid-manual-tuning-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added more info on [SMD crystal packages](/pcb-design/component-packages/crystal-packages/), including the 7x5mm package.
    {{% figure src="smd-crystal-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}

* Added a new page on [Resonant LLC Converters](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/resonant-llc-converters/), a form of SMPS (switch-mode power supply).
    {{% figure src="resonant-llc-converters-screenshot.png" width="600px" %}}
