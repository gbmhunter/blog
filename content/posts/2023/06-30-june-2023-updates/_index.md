* Added information about electrolyte leakage in electrolytic capacitors.

* Fixed bug which resulting in the embedded circuitjs iframe's from being displayed correctly (unsure of what was caused the problem to occur in the first place).

* Added info on differences between "solid" and "wet" tantalum capacitors.

* Added a new aside shortcode for Markdown and changed the styling of the asides (called admonitions in AsciiDoc) so that the title and icon are a top-bar rather than a side-bar (looks better when there is longer content in the aside).

* Added info on the TO-220-7 and TO-220-7C variants of the TO-220 component package family.

* Added a new page on the [TO-206 component package family](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-206-component-package/).

* Fixed error where the `SOT-490` was incorrectly labelled as `SOD-490`.

* Added a new page on [Switching PSU Control Methodologies](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/control-methodologies/).

* Added a new page on [Mid-Chip Solder Balls](/pcb-design/mid-chip-solder-balls/).

* Added info on feedforward, standard form, series form, and diagrams to the [PID Control page](/programming/general/pid-control/).

* Added info on manual tuning to the [PID Control page](/programming/general/pid-control/), including a worked example.

* Added more info on [SMD crystal packages](/pcb-design/component-packages/crystal-packages/), including the 7x5mm package.

* Added a new page on [Resonant LLC Converters](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/resonant-llc-converters/), a form of SMPS (switch-mode power supply).
