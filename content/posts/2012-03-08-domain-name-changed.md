The subscription for this sites default domain name, www.undergroundmadlabs.com, was coming to an end. I thought this would be a good time to change the name to reflect the site title. Choosing undergroundmadlabs.com was a bad decision on my part, made at a time when I wasn't too sure on a good name. Soon after I brought it for a year, I realised Clandestine Laboratories was better, and rebranded the site. However, I was stuck with the domain name (well, unless I wanted to pay double), until the subscription ran out.

So now, after a week of hassle to get blog.mbedded.ninja transferred to justhost.com, and then moving the WordPress installation from one account to another, it's finally working! The site was out for a few days while I struggled to get the WordPress installation working happily on the new server. I couldn't of done this without interconnectIT's tutorial "[Migrating A Wordpress/WPMU/Buddypress Website](http://interconnectit.com/719/migrating-a-wordpresswpmubuddypress-website/)" and the php script "[Wordpress (and others) Safe Search And Replace Tool](http://interconnectit.com/124/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/)", again by interconnectIT.
