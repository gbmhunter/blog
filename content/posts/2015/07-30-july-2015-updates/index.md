* Updates to the [Transformer page](/electronics/components/transformers).

* New theme, twentyfifteen! (Avada was getting too complicated)

* Added information on [adding comments (well, pseudo comments) to JSON files on the JSON page](/programming/serialization-formats/jason/).

* Moved all the [op-amp schematic diagrams on the Op-Amp page](/electronics/components/op-amps) over to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), the online Latex editor.  

    {{< figure src="/images/2011/09/op-amp-schematic-differential-amplifier.png" width="436px" caption="An op-amp configured as a differential amplifier."  >}}
    
* New [General Routing Tips page](/pcb-design/general-routing-tips).

* Information on [Aspect Ratios added to the Pads, Vias and Holes page](/pcb-design/pads-vias-holes#aspect-ratios).  

    {{< figure src="/images/2015/10/aspect-ratio-page-screenshot.png" width="312px" caption="A screenshot of the aspect ratio information added the 'Pads, Vias And Holes' page as part of the PCB design section."  >}}  

* Information on [Microvias added to the Pads, Vias and Holes page](/pcb-design/pads-vias-holes#microvias).

* Added information to the [PCI Express (PCIe) page](/electronics/communication-protocols/pci-express-pcie).

* New [FPGAs sub-section](/electronics/components/fpgas) under Electronics->Components.

* New [Xilinx 7 Series (Artix-7, Kintex-7, Virtex-7, Zynq-7000) page](/electronics/components/fpgas/xilinx-7-series-artix-7-kintex-7-virtex-7-zynq-7000/).

* New [Logic Families page](/electronics/circuit-design/logic-familes).
