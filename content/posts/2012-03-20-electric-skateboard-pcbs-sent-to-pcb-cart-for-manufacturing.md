Finally, the electric skateboard PCB's have been sent away for manufacturing. I eventually chose [PCB Cart](http://www.pcbcart.com/) after discovering that I couldn't run the PCB's as a 'Prototype' at [Silver Circuits](http://www.custompcb.com/) (their maximum Prototype PCB size was 160mm in any direction, my panel was 200mm). See the [Electrical Suppliers page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/other/electrical-suppliers) for more info on PCB manufacturers.

The boards ended up costing NZ$330 (ouch!). This was for 3 panels of 3 boards (adding two panels only added NZ$14 to the price, so it's worth it for back-up boards).
There is the the motherboard PCB, the half-bridge PCB (both to be mounted on the skateboard), and the remote control PCB (mounted on the hand-held controller). I'm crossing my fingers and hoping there are no mistakes (well, at least no major ones that would require a redesign). One thing that I will do differently next time I design a PCB is to make sure the minimum annular ring is 0.3mm or larger. Since I had 0.2mm vias with 0.4mm holes, I had to raise the annular ring spec when submitting it to PCB cart (from 0.3mm to 0.1mm), which added about NZ$40 to the price.

I chose the longest lead-time (12 days) to keep costs down, hopefully they will ready by the weekend after next!
