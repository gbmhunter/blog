* New [Mains Power page](/electronics/components/connectors/mains-power/) under Electronics->Components->Connectors.

* Updates to the [SPI Protocol page](/electronics/communication-protocols/spi-communication-protocol/) under Electronics->Communication Protocols.  

    {{< figure src="/images/2011/09/typical-spi-connections.jpg" caption="The typical SPI connections that an IC will have." width="200px" >}}
  
* New [Circuit Protection sub-section](/electronics/components/circuit-protection/) and [PTC Type Thermistor page](/electronics/components/circuit-protection/ptc-type-thermistor/).

* Updates to the [D2PAK (TO-263) Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/d2pak-to-263-component-package/), with more info on the TO-263 THIN package.  

    {{< figure src="/images/2015/04/d2pak-to-263-component-package-3d-render.jpg" width="300px" caption="A 3D render of the D2PAK (TO-263) component package." >}}
    
* New [4-20mA Current Loop page](/electronics/communication-protocols/4-20ma-current-loops/), under Electronics->Communication Protocols.  

    {{< figure src="/images/2016/03/4-20ma-current-loop-interface-to-micro-schematic-with-filter-and-buffer.png" width="800px" caption="An schematic showing how to interface a 4-20mA current loop signal to the ADC on a microcontroller. The circuit also has a low-pass filter and a buffer."  >}}
    
* Updates to the [D-sub Connectors page](/electronics/components/connectors/d-subminiature-d-sub/) including info about filtered D-sub connectors and the various sizes and shapes of D-sub connectors.
