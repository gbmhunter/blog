* New [Object Orientated C page](/programming/languages/c/object-orientated-c).

* New [Humidity Sensors page.](/electronics/components/sensors/humidity-sensors)

    {{< figure src="/images/2016/03/magnus-equation-humidity-temperature-and-dew-point.png" width="637px" caption="A screenshot of the Magnus equation, which calculates the dew point from the relative humidity and temperature."  >}}

* New [Quantum Platform (QP) page](/programming/operating-systems/quantum-platform-qp) under Programming->Operating Systems.  

    {{< figure src="/images/2016/02/quantum-leaps-qp-logo.png" width="259px" caption="The Quantum Leaps QP logo. Image from http://www.state-machine.com/."  >}}

* Added info about the [Dangerous While() Loops Inside The PSoC I2C API](/programming/microcontrollers/psoc/components#dangerous-while-loops), as part of the PSoC->Components page.

* New [Dependency Injection page](/programming/design-patterns/dependency-injection) under Programming->Design Patterns.

* New [Bit Masking page](/programming/languages/c/bit-fields-and-bit-manipulation-masking) under Programming->Languages->C.  

    {{< figure src="/images/2016/03/binary-sparse-matrix-style.jpg" width="500px" >}}

* Info on the dew point and the Magnus equation added to the [Humidity Sensors page](/electronics/components/sensors/humidity-sensors).
