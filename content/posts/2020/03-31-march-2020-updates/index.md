* Added the new {{% link text="USON Component Package" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/uson-component-package" %}} page.

* Updated the {{% link text="WSON Component Package" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/wson-component-package" %}} page.

* Added projection info to the {{% link text="rasterio page" src="/space/rasterio" %}}.

* Added search functionality. When I first moved this blog from a "dynamic" Wordpress-based server to static hosting and Hugo, I thought search functionality was just one of those luxuries I would have to give up. But apparently not! As long as all the search data is assembled at site build time, we can perform the search functionality client side (i.e. on your computer, using your processor :-D). See the blog post {{% link text="We Now Have Search" src="" %}} for more information!

* Added an section on how to remove masked values from a masked array to the {{% link text="Numpy page" src="/programming/languages/python/numpy#removing-masked-values-from-an-array" %}}.

* Added a new tutorial on {{% link text="geopandas" src="/programming/languages/python/a-tutorial-on-geopandas" %}}.

* Added a the page {{% link text="Python And File Paths" src="/programming/languages/python/python-and-file-paths" %}} with information on the `pathlib` module.

* Added a new page on the {{% link text="The Three Classical Pythagorean Means" src="/mathematics/statistics/the-three-classical-pythagorean-means" %}}.
