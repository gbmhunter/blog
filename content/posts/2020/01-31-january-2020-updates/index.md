* Added the {{% link text="Happy New Year 2020 page" src="" %}}, which compiles interesting blog statistics for the 2019 year.

* Renamed all leaf nodes filenames from `_index.md` to `index.md`, as using the former led to the tag pages not being created.

* Information on handling warnings has been added to the {{% link text="Numpy page" src="" %}}.

* Updated the {{% link text="TSOC-6 Component Package page" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/tsoc-component-package" %}} with more clarification on the differences between the different variants (D6+1, D6-1, D6N+1 and D6N-1).

* Added a new {{% link text="QFP Component Package page" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/qfp-component-package" %}}, which will consolidate all of the variant information (e.g. TQFP) that existed on individual pages.

* Updated many component package pages, including:
    * {{% link text="Micro3" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/micro3-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="SOT-23" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-23-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="SOT-346" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-346-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="TO-3" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/to-3-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="TO-39" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/to-39-component-package" %}}

    And also added the following packages to the component package database:

    * {{% link text="PDIP" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/pdip-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="SMT3" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/smt3-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="TO-23" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/to-23-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="TO-236AA" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/to-236aa-component-package" %}}
    * {{% link text="TO-236AB" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/to-236ab-component-package" %}}

* Switched the site title and content title around in the HTML page title, such that it is now:

    ```
    <page title> | mbedded.nina
    ```

    This makes it easier to determine what the page is when you have a lot of tabs open on a tab-based browser such as Chrome or Edge.

* Added cached external content to the {{% link text="How To Calculate Maximum Track Current page" src="" %}}.

* Added more specific information about dynamic memory allocation on embedded systems to the {{% link text="Dynamic Memory Allocation page" src="" %}}.
