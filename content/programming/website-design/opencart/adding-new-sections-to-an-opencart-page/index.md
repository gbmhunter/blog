title: Adding New Sections To An OpenCart Page
type: page
---

Adding new sections to an OpenCart page is not the easiest thing to do, but there are some great walk-throughs which make it easier. I followed [Jamie Taylor's tutorial](http://forum.opencart.com/viewforum.php?f=23) (Adding Positions to OpenCart 1.5.1.1 Theme) on HTMYELL.

However, his syntax use changes when giving example code for the `/catalog/controller/common/content_middle.php` file. He suddenly starts using the name 'home-one when previously he was using 'content-middle'.

Stack Overflow also has a [good example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7421790/opencart-1-5-how-to-add-module-in-a-header), but slightly less generic and the section doesn't get added to the admin GUI.
