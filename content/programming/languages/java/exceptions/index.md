## Checked Exceptions

Any exception that is a subclass of `Exception` (or `Exception` itself), except for `RuntimeException` and it's subclasses, is a _checked exception_.

**The Java compiler forces you to catch checked exceptions** (and either swallow or re-throw).

Some common examples of checked exceptions are:

* IOException
* FileNotFoundException
* ClassNotFoundException
* InvocationTargetException
* SQLException
* DataAccessException 

## ConcurrentModificationException

The exception can be thrown while trying to remove an element from a Collection (e.g. an `ArrayList`) while iterating over it using a standard for loop.

Another way a `ConcurrentModificationException` can be thrown is if you forget to copy a Collection and rather take a reference to it, and then try and access the Collection.

For example, the following line won't actually copy the entire list:

```java
// This does not actually copy the list
ArrayList<Integer> newList = oldList.subList(0, 5);
oldList.get(2); // This will throw a ConcurrentModificationException

// Perform a deep copy of the list
ArrayList<Integer> newListSafe = new ArrayList<>(oldList.subList(0, 5));
oldList.get(2); // This is o.k., since newListSafe is a deep copy of the list
```
