title: How To Make Your Library Support find_package()
type: page
---

## Overview

As a code library maintainer, if you want your users to be able to use `find_package(MyPackage)` in CMake files, you need to now how to create a CMake _package_.

Annoyingly, this is not a simple task!

If the user performs a local install, they may call cmake as:

```cmake
build$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..
```

## Referencing Your Package From Downstream Build

Once you have created your package, you will be wanting to be able to use find_package() in a downstream package.

The CMake variable `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` can be used to specify local install locations for your dependent packages.
