== TagConnect

Segger has jumped on the band wagon and provides a "J-Link 6-pin Needle Adapter" which looks like a re-branded TagConnect to mate with their J-Link programmer.

== Cortex Debug Connector Pinouts

There are industry-standard connector sizes and pinouts for debugging the Cortex range of ARM-based microcontrollers (e.g. microcontrollers with a Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M3, e.t.c.).

=== 10-pin, 1.27mm Pitch

The 10-pin, 2x5, 1.27mm pitch (0.050") connector is the most common debug connector used with Cortex-based microcontrollers.

The official connector is the link:https://www.samtec.com/products/ftsh-105-01-l-dv-k[Samtec FTSH-105-01], yet luckily these header-style connectors are standardized across manufacturers and almost any 1.27mm 2x5 header-style connector will work.

Sometimes `Pin 7` is removed from the male header, and the female header has a blank position in the same location (i.e. no receptacle). This is to "key" the header so it can't be mated incorrectly. Another way of preventing incorrect mating is to use a keyed shroud.

`Pin 9 (GND)` can also be used for detection.
