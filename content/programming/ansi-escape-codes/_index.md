## Overview

ANSI escape codes are special "in-band" character sequences that are used to control the formatting, color, and other output characteristics of text in a terminal or console. They can be used to enhance the user experience of a terminal, create advanced text-based user interfaces, and are often used in command-line applications. They are also very useful in microcontroller firmware for creating sophisticated debug shells and colouring debug serial logs.
