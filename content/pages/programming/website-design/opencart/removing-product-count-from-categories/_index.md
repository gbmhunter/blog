title: Removing Product Count From Categories

The product count that is automatically added to product categories can disrupt the visual appearance of the site, gives the user no really useful information, and can make your store look empty or poorly maintained if you have a small number of products.




The product is easy to remove in code, and even easier to remove using a VQmod file.




You can download the free OpenCart extension, [Simple Remove Product Count From Categories](https://forum.opencart.com/viewtopic.php?f=131&t=47547), which will remove the product count from the front-page categories, search pages, and the drop-down main menu.




The following image shows the before and after when removing the product count from the categories on OpenCart's front page.
