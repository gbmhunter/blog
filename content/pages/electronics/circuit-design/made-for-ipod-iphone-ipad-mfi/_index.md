# Overview

Official information about this protocol is restricted by Apple to people who have joined the MFi program. Therefore, I can't mention anything of this page which isn't public knowledge.

You can get to [Apple's MFi landing page here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/).

# iPod Accessory Protocol (iAP)

This is the protocol you can use to talk to Apple devices with.

# 3rd Party Libraries

Microchip provides a MFi library for handling initial communication with an iPod or iPhone, as well as a hardware wrapper, allowing firmware developers to easily utilise the iAP.
