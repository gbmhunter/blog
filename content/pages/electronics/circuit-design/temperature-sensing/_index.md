# Temperature Management of Components
The behaviour of electrical components is highly dependent on the temperature. Almost always you will see performance measures of data sheets such as resolution, accuracy and speed decrease when specified over a larger temperature range. Temperature fluctuations can also damage components by repeated thermal expansion and cooling. Temperature changes can also cause race conditions which destroy electrical hardware (such as transistors).

# Defined Temperature Ranges

Automotive Temperature Range: -40°C to 125°C
