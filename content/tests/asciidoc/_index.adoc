:fn-test-1: footnote:test-1[Test footnote 1.]

Page contents (table of contents, ToC) should be shown either above (viewport < 768px) or to the right (viewport >=768px). Sections should have numbers in front of them, both in the ToC and in-front of the section headings.

WARNING: This page is in notes format, and may not be of the same quality as other pages on this site.

== Maths

An example on an inline equation stem:[y = \frac{1}{x^2}] is embedded in this sentence.

And here is a block-level equation. There second line of the equation should be numbered.

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
y = \frac{1}{x^2} \nonumber \\
y = 2
\end{align}
++++

[.text-center]
where: +
stem:[y] is the output, in Watts \(W\) +
stem:[x] is the input, in Hertz \(Hz\) +

== Warning Is Notes

Use the below block for telling the reader a specific page is still in "notes" format:

WARNING: This page is in notes format, and may not be of the same quality as other pages on this site.

== Code

Inline `uint8_t code` is here.

Below is a C++ code block:

.Some C++ code
[source,c++]
----
include <stdio>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Testing..." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
----

Below is a Ruby code block:

.Some Ruby code
[source,ruby]
----
require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
----

== Example Blocks

The below example block should have a title and a slight red background:

[example]
.Shot noise example
--
A current of stem:[100mA] measured over a bandwidth of stem:[1kHz] gives a RMS shot noise current value of:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
i_n &= \sqrt{2IqB} \nonumber \\
    &= \sqrt{2*1A*1.602e^{-19} C*1kHz} \nonumber \\
    &= 17.9nA \nonumber \\
\end{align}
++++

== Images

There should be a vector image below that is `300px` wide, with the caption "Hello, world":

.Hello, world
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=300]

Below should be two images side-by-side (both with captions), using our custom `.imagerow` class. The images should be centered on the page:

[.imagerow]
--
.Image on the left. 
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=250px, height=200px]

.Image on the right. 
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=250px, height=200px]
--

[[hello-world]]
.Hello, world
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=300]

The above image has an ID, and you should see a reference to it right here: <<hello-world>>.

== References

This sentence contains a bibliographic reference at the end of it. It should be superscript because the reference text starts with "bib".<<bib-example-1>>.

This is a link to another section in this page: <<_warning_is_notes>>.

== Footnotes

This sentence should have a footnote at the end of it{fn-test-1}.

== Tables

|===
| Header Col. 1 | Header Col. 2

| Cell 1, 1 | Cell 1, 2
| Cell 2, 1 | Cell 2, 2
|===

Below is a table with `%autowidth` set, this means is should only be as wide as the content within it

[%autowidth]
|===
| First letter  | Element description

| A             | XSPICE code model
| B             | Behavioural (arbitrary) source
|===

Below is a table with more than one header row. Since there is more than one row, it's actually put in the `tbody` element, but still has `th` cells.

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
2+h| This cell spans two cols.
2+h| Same.
2+h| Same.

h| Second row of header cells.
h| Same.
h| Same.
h| Same.
h| Same.
h| Same.

| This
| row
| is
| not
| a

Below is a table which should be wider than the standard content width, and have a horizontal scrollable bar at the bottom.
