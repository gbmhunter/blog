:fn-test-1: footnote:test-1[Test footnote 1.]

Page contents (table of contents, ToC) should be shown either above (viewport < 768px) or to the right (viewport >=768px). Sections should have numbers in front of them, both in the ToC and in-front of the section headings.

== Maths

An example on an inline equation stem:[y = \frac{1}{x^2}] is embedded in this sentence.

And here is a block-level equation. There second line of the equation should be numbered.

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
y = \frac{1}{x^2} \nonumber \\
y = 2
\end{align}
++++

[.text-center]
where: +
stem:[y] is the output, in Watts \(W\) +
stem:[x] is the input, in Hertz \(Hz\) +

== Warning Is Notes

Use the below block for telling the reader a specific page is still in "notes" format:

WARNING: This page is in notes format, and may not be of the same quality as other pages on this site.

== Code

Inline `uint8_t code` is here.

Below is a C++ code block:

.Some C++ code
[source,c++]
----
include <stdio>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Testing..." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
----

Below is a Ruby code block:

.Some Ruby code
[source,ruby]
----
require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
----

== Example Blocks

The below example block should have a title and a slight red background:

[example]
.Shot noise example
--
A current of stem:[100mA] measured over a bandwidth of stem:[1kHz] gives a RMS shot noise current value of:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
i_n &= \sqrt{2IqB} \nonumber \\
    &= \sqrt{2*1A*1.602e^{-19} C*1kHz} \nonumber \\
    &= 17.9nA \nonumber \\
\end{align}
++++
--

== Images

There should be a vector image below that is `300px` wide, with the caption "Hello, world":

.Hello, world
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=300]

Below should be two images side-by-side (both with captions), using our custom `.imagerow` class. The images should be centered on the page:

[.imagerow]
--
.Image on the left. 
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=250px, height=200px]

.Image on the right. 
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=250px, height=200px]
--

[[hello-world]]
.Hello, world
image::example-vector-image.svg[width=300]

The above image has an ID, and you should see a reference to it right here: <<hello-world>>.

== References

This sentence contains a bibliographic reference at the end of it. It should be superscript because the reference text starts with "bib".<<bib-example-1>>.

This is a link to another section in this page: <<_warning_is_notes>>.

== Footnotes

This sentence should have a footnote at the end of it{fn-test-1}.

== Tables

|===
| Header Col. 1 | Header Col. 2

| Cell 1, 1 | Cell 1, 2
| Cell 2, 1 | Cell 2, 2
|===

Below is a table with `%autowidth` set, this means is should only be as wide as the content within it

[%autowidth]
|===
| First letter  | Element description

| A             | XSPICE code model
| B             | Behavioral (arbitrary) source
|===

== Admonitions

TIP: This is a tip. I should be green and have a bulb icon on my left.

WARNING: This is a warning. I should be red.

Below is an Admonition block:

[TIP]
====
I am an Admonition block.

I can contain many things.

== Quotes

Below is a quote. There should be a vertical bar to the left of the quote and the quote should be indented.

[quote, MIL-STD-461E, Section 40.3.6 (4.3.6): Power source impedance]
____
The impedance of power sources providing input power to the EUT shall be controlled by Line
Impedance Stabilization Networks (LISNs) for all measurement procedures of this document
unless otherwise stated in a particular test procedure.
