## Overview

_Inferential statistics_ are ways of analyzing and interpreting data. Inferential statistics consist of _parametric_ and _non-parametric_ tests. **Parametric tests can be used when the data's distribution is sufficiently close to a normal distribution**, and if this is not the case, then non-parameteric tests must be used. Non-parametric tests can also be used upon normally-distributed data. So why bother with parametric tests at all? Parametric tests should be preferred over non-parametric tests whenever possible due to their increased statistical "power"...they are better at finding (or proving) relationships between variables.

Examples of parametric tests:

* One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
* Paried t-test
* Pearson coefficient of correlation

Examples of non-parametric tests:

* Wilcoxon signed-rank test
* Kruskal-Wallis test
* Spearman's rank correlation
