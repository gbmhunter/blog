## Overview

The _Wheatstone bridge_ (a.k.a. _resistance bridge_) is a circuit consisting of four resistive components. It has the benefit of being able to perform accurate measurements of resistance. <<basic-schematic-of-wheatstone-bridge>> shows the basic schematic.

stem:[Eq.\ \ref{eq-wheatstone-general}] is the general equation for the Wheatstone bridge.

\begin{align}
\label{eq-wheatstone-general}
V_{OUT} = V_{DC} \left( \frac{R2}{R1 + R2} - \frac{R4}{R3 + R4} \right)
\end{align}
++++

The output voltage (and consequentially, output current) is 0 when both of the "legs" of the bridge are balanced. That is:

\begin{align}
V_{OUT} = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad \frac{R2}{R1} = \frac{R4}{R3}

## History

The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833, but got it's name from Sir Charles Wheatstone, who improved and popularized the circuit in 1843<<bib-maglab-wheatstone-history>>.
