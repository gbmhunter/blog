## Overview

Digital logic is the study and application of the fundamentals in digital (binary) electronics, e.g. gates, flip-flops, state machines.

## Karnaugh Maps

Karnaugh maps are a way of simplifying combinational logic, often used before realising a combination equation into a number of gates to reduce the complexity.

## Logic Simulators

[CEDAR Logic Simulator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cedarlogic/) is my personal favourite. Free, easy to use, colours the wires depending on their state, and allows for named nets as well as direct connections.

## Example Logic Circuits

## 6-State Binary Counter

Category: Counter  
Expression Style: Sum of Products  
No. of Gates: 14  
No. of Flip-flops:  3  
1-Bit Inputs: 2 + reset  
1-Bit Outputs: 3  

Tested On:

* Simulation: Yes ([CEDAR Logic Simulator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cedarlogic/))
* Hardware: Yes

Downloads: [CEDAR Logic Simulator File](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B9GgsT_bUc27SW5sTGZDSlhWQkU)

The 6-state binary counter is a counter which counts from 000 to 101 in the normal binary fashion before resetting back to 0. The output increments on every rising-edge of the count pulse, and the direction pin (upNDown) determines the count direction (when upNDown = 1, the counter goes from 000 to 101, when upNDown is 0 the counter goes from 101 to 000).

The flip-flop equations expressed as sums of products are:

<div>$$  
Q_2 = \bar{Q_2}.\bar{Q_1}.\bar{Q_0}.\bar{y} + \bar{Q_2}.Q_1.Q_0.y + Q_2.\bar{Q_1}.Q_0.\bar{y} + Q_2.\bar{Q_1}.\bar{Q_0}.y \\ \\  
 Q_1 = \bar{Q_2}.\bar{Q_1}.Q_0.y + \bar{Q_2}.Q_1.\bar{Q_0}.y + \bar{Q_2}.Q_1.Q_0.\bar{y} + Q_2.\bar{Q_1}.\bar{Q_0}.\bar{y} \\ \\  
 Q_0 = \bar{Q_2}.\bar{Q_0} + Q_2.\bar{Q_1}.\bar{Q_0} \\ \\  
$$</div>

## 3-Bit Grey Encoded Counter

Category: Counter  
Expression Style: Sum of Products  
No. of Gates: 14  
No. of Flip-flops: 3  
1-Bit Inputs: 2 + reset  
1-Bit Outputs: 3  

Tested On:

* Simulation: Yes ([CEDAR Logic Simulator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cedarlogic/))
* Hardware: Yes

Download: [CEDAR Logic Simulator File](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B9GgsT_bUc27REVITzhmQk9DMk0)

The 3-Bit Grey Encoded Counter is a counter that counts from 0 to 7 in binary in a grey encoded fashion. The counter increments on every rising edge of the bit 'count' and the direction bit 'upNDown' determines the direction of counting.

## Quadrature Detection Circuit

This quadrature detection circuit is built entirely in hardware, and only uses one flip-flop. It is useful for detecting the direction that an encoder that outputs quadrature signals is spinning in. Potential applications include [BLDC motor control](/electronics/circuit-design/bldc-motor-control). This circuit can be built entirely in [reconfigurable PSoC on-chip logic](/programming/microcontrollers/psoc).

When the encoder is spinning in one direction, the output will be logic high (1), when it is spinning in the opposite direction, it will be logic low (0).

## Delay Circuit

A simple delay circuit can be made just by chaining DQ flip-flops together in series (the output of one feeds the input of another). For every flip-flop, the signal will be delayed by one clock-cycle (assuming they all share the same clock source).

This can be used to make a simple timer. Obviously, a limitation is that a flip-flop is needed for every clock cycle of delay needed (try that with a 1000 clock cycle delay!). More advanced timers use binary encoding with the flip-flops to achieve a greater number of states for a lower number of flip-flops.
