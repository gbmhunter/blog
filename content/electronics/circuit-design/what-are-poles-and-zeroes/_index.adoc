== Overview

**A value of stem:[s] that causes the a transfer function to be 0 is called a _zero_, and a value of stem:[s] that causes the transfer function to be infinite is called a _pole_**. Zeroes generally occur when a factor in the numerator is 0 (one notable exception is that a zero can also occur if the denominator tends towards infinity, usually as stem:[s \rightarrow \infty]), poles generally occur when a factor in the denominator is 0.

The poles and zeros of a system can tell you much about how the system performs -- it can tell you if the system is stable, how fast it responds

A first-order low-pass RC filter has the transfer function shown in Eq. stem:[\ref{eq:rc-xfer-fn}].

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
\label{eq:rc-xfer-fn}
H(s) = \frac{a_0}{s + w_0}
\end{align}
++++

This system has a pole at stem:[s = w_0] and a zero at stem:[s = \infty].

== Pole Zero Plots

Zeroes contribute +90 of phase and increase the magnitude, above the zero frequency.
Poles contribute -90 of phase and decrease the magnitude, above the pole frequency.
