## Solder Bridges

Solder bridges are unwanted flecks of solder that cause shorts between two or more tracks on a PCB.

## Flux Residue

PCB soldering flux is designed to be as PCB-friendly as possible, but flux residue from soldering can still cause problems in the long run (e.g. accelerated corrosion, moisture absorbtion leading to conduction).
