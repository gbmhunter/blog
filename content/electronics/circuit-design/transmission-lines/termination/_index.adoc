## Overview

_Termination_ is the process of adding components (usually resistors, but sometimes capacitors and inductors) to the ends of transmission lines (the start, the end, or both) to prevent things like reflections due to impedance mis-matches.

## Series Termination

_Series termination_ (a.k.a. _back termination_).

.How to do series termination. Resistor stem:[R_S] is placed at the output of the driver before the transmission line. stem:[R_S] is equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.
