## Overview

* Quick-change tips
* Maximum heating power
* Heating rate (high quality soldering irons can heat-up to the set temperature within about 2 seconds!)
* Stable temperature control under different loads

For all but the lightest of work you will want to choose a _soldering station_ instead of a _soldering iron_. The station provides a holder for the iron, keeping it in a safe place while you do other work (so you don't burn yourself!). It also allows to a lighter and higher power iron, as most of the electronics can now be located in the freestanding control unit rather than in the handheld iron.

## Brands

### Hakko

An American company with a vivid and memorable blue/yellow brand color.

### JBC

The creme-de-la-creme of soldering iron brands. JBC makes some of the highest-quality soldering stations, but as expected, this comes at a very high price.

### Weller

The Weller brand is associated with quality, second only to JBC. Naturally, their products are generally cheaper than JBCs to compensate.

## Hobbyist Range

### Hakko FX888D

No quick change tips

### Weller WE1010

No quick change tips

## Professional Range

### Hakko FM203-15

A dual port soldering station. For use with the FM-2027 soldering iron which takes the Hakko _T12_ range of tips. Note that the T12 range are quick-change, and you start paying more than double for quick-changes tips (versus the T18 range).

**Note that that tips are not truly quick change until you also purchase extra _Soldering Pencil Sleeves_**. These are proprietary hand-grips that slide onto the tip. Once each tip has one of these, you can quickly change tips by unclipping the sleeve + tip from the rest of the iron and inserting a new one. These sleeves also remove the need for using pliers or a rubber mat to remove hot tips.

This soldering station can also accept Hakko tweezers. A great choice for popping off and on small 0402/0603/0805 chip resistors and capacitors is the FM-2023 Mini SMD Hot Tweezers with the T9-1L tips:
