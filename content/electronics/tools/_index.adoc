## Overview

Descriptions, usages, pictures and more info of various tools used by embedded engineers.

## Microscopes

=== Digital

Digital microscopes are a great tool to have on an electronics workbench. Coupled with a screen, they allow you to look up close at a PCB without having to peer down the sights of a optical microscope.

* Depth-of-field: The larger the depth of field, the less zooming you have to do to get different height components and tracks on your PCB into focus.

=== Optical (Analogue)

==== AmScope 7X-45X Simul-Focal Stereo Lockable Zoom Microscope on Dual Arm Boom Stand
