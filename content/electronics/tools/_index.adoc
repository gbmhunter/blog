== Overview

Descriptions, usages, pictures and more info of various tools used by embedded engineers.

== Oscilloscopes

An _oscilloscope_ (or just _scope_) is to an electrical engineer what a hammer is to a builder. It is a general purpose tool which lets you view voltages (and currents) in a circuit over time. It's cheaper counterpart is a digital multimeter, however they can typically only display the voltage with an update rate of a few Hertz, and only display a discrete value, not the waveform over time. Oscilloscopes can also measure much faster signals and much faster rates and trigger (take a snapshot) on specific conditions. They typically also have multiple input channels (at least two) so you can compare two voltage waveforms side-by-side.

Mixed-signal oscilloscopes (MSOs) measure both traditional analogue signals as well as digital signals.

=== Oscilloscope Specifications

==== Bandwidth

The bandwidth of a scope defines the range of frequencies it can measure. The upper limit is defined when the observed signal drops by -3dB (drops to 70.7%) of the true value. Because all oscilloscopes start measuring at DC (0Hz), this also defines the highest frequency the scope can measure. El cheapo scopes have a bandwidth of 100MHz. 

=== Probes

* Passive: Non-powered
* Active: Powered with active buffering and/or amplification of the signal within the probe itself (before it gets to the oscilloscope).

10:1 probes are the industry standard. Almost all oscilloscopes have an input impedance of `\(1M\Omega\)` when looking into the connector on the front panel of the scope.

Capacitance increases when you go from 10:1 to 1:1. e.g. a 10:1 passive probe may have 10pF of capacitance while an equivalent 1:1 probe may have approx. 100pF. You also lose some input resistance, e.g. it drops from `\(10M\Omega\)` to `\(1M\Omega\)`.

1:1 probes can be good for measuring small levels of noise as they effectively increase the minimum resolution of the oscilloscope by 10 (compared to a 10:1 probe).

=== Probe Compensation

Some scope probes allow you to adjust the probes compensation.

Without the variable capacitor, the resistance of the probe combined with the resistance and capacitance of the scope will create a low-pass filter that will greatly distort high frequency measurements. The variable capacitor is added in parallel with the `\(9M\Omega\)` probe resistance so that there is both a resistive and capacitive potential divider. The capacitance is then adjusted so that both the resistor divider and capacitor divider have the same division ratio. This ensures the response of the probe is flat across the frequencies of interest.

=== Maths Functions

I have never had great success using the maths functions on a scope to measure differential signals (by using two single-ended inputs and subtracting one from the other).

=== Manufacturers

==== Keysight

Mid to high-end scope manufacturer, in the same class as Tektronix.

==== Tenma

Low-end scope manufacturer.

== Multimeters

Multimeters are multi-purpose electrical measurement devices used by both electricians and electronics engineers (among other disciplines).

Some multimeters are designed for electricians (people who deal primarily with 240VAC), which are not as suitable for electronics engineers.

=== Ghost Voltages (Low-Impedance Voltage Measurements)

Typically, voltage measurements are done at the highest-impedance achievable (stem:[>1M\Omega]) by the multimeter so that the multimeter does not effect the circuit it is measuring. However, this can sometimes lead to "ghost voltages". This is when a real but high-impedance voltage is present on a circuit, normally due to the circuit picking up noise from near-by circuits via phenomenon such as capacitive coupling. This voltage, although real, is misleading as it does not represent the voltage a load (or person getting a shock) would actually see. For this reason these voltages are called _ghost voltages_.

Some newer digital multimeters come with a low impedance voltage measurement mode to ignore these ghost voltages. This is especially useful for when working with mains power (115/240VAC) and trying to determine if a voltage on a wire is a significant danger or not. Examples of multimeters which have a low-impedance voltage measurement setting include the link:https://www.fluke.com/en/product/electrical-testing/digital-multimeters/fluke-117[Fluke 117 Digital Multimeter].

Older, analogue multimeters are not as susceptible to the ghost voltage problem as they typically have a lower impedance when measuring voltages, normally around stem:[10k\Omega].

Low-impedance mode should not be used when working with sensitive, small-signal circuitry. The low-impedance of the multimeter might draw enough current to disrupt the circuit and will give you incorrect readings.

== Logic Analysers

Logic analysers are electronic tools which connect to digital circuitry and decode serial or parallel communication protocols.

High-end oscilloscopes now include logic analysers, either built-in or as an additional module/license. Tektronic charges a license per communication protocol. 

=== Saleae

Saleae is probably the most expensive well-known logic analyzer brand. As of April 2020, the 8-channel, 500MS/s (Samples/second), 100MHz, USB3.0 Saleae logic analyzer (the _Logic Pro 8_) will cost USD$699, which is quite a lot of money for JUST a logic analyzer.

=== DreamSourceLab

DreamSourceLab provides the _DSView_ software for viewing the digital signals from the _DSLogic_ series of logic analysers. _DSView_ is compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux. It uses the _sigrok project_ to provide all of the protocol decoders and therefore supports many of the protocols listed on https://sigrok.org/wiki/Protocol_decoders.

.A screenshot of the DSView v1.1.2 software.

Whilst a setup `.exe` is provided for Windows and a `.dmg` for MacOS, no pre-built executables are provided for Linux, and you have to build yourself from the source code. Easy instructions are provided in the `INSTALL` text file.

== AC/DC Electronics Loads

A _AC_ or _DC_ _Electronic Load (a.k.a. _Active Load_) is a piece of electronic test equipment which can act as either a programmable resistance, voltage sink (voltage source, but can only sink power, not produce it) or current sink. They act as a load by converting the incoming electrical power into heat, just like a resistor. However, rather than using a standard fixed resistor (or sequence of switched fixed resistors), they typically use a transistor(s) to dissipate the energy so that it's "resistance" can be changed electronically, hence why they are also known as _active_ loads. They are usually designed to dissipate 100's of Watts or more of power (depending on the model). They are separated into two distinct families:

* DC electronic loads (the most common variety)
* AC electronic loads

AC and DC electronic loads are used to:

* Load up power supplies to test their response under a range of operating conditions (incl. 0A to full current, and 0V to highest voltage)
* Act as constant-current sinks to drive LEDs when performing testing/design validation.

=== TekBox TBOH02

The _TekBox TBOH02_ DC load is a great, simple, low-cost DC load. It is self-powered, meaning it powers itself from the energy dissipated via the "load" it pretends to be. 25W continuous power dissipation with no fan, 100W with fan. The advantage of it being an analogue, self-powered load means that there will be no digital/PSU/control-circuitry noise superimposed onto the measurements you are making.

This device is open-source hardware (design is based of https://www.edn.com/precision-active-load-operates-as-low-as-2v/, however EDN's link to the PDF/schematics is broken as of 2021-06-22), the full schematics, board files and BOM are provided at https://www.tekbox.com/product/tboh02-self-powered-active-load/. Schematics and board files are in the Eagle file format.

== USB-to-Serial Converters

=== FTDI Converters

FTDI (Future Technology Devices International Ltd.) is a popular and reputable designer and manufacturer of USB-to-Serial converters. They make a range of ICs for this purpose, as well and manufacturing useful products which use these ICs (such as USB-to-serial cables).

As of 2016, their ICs are commonly found in good quality USB-to-serial hardware (more so than one of their main competitors, Prolific).

=== Latency

USB-to-Serial converters introduce a fair bit of delays into serial communications. and depending on your latency requirements, this may effect your design.

.The conditions which will cause an FTDI IC to send received serial data to the computer. Especially notice the 16ms 'latency timer'. Image from 'FTDI – AN232B-04 – Data Throughput. Latency and Handshaking'.

The below image is a screenshot of FTDI RX/TX data captured with a logic analyser. The computer was running Java code which sent an `0x02` response as soon as it received an `0x01` byte.

.FTDI RX and TX data captured by a logic analyser, with the computer running Java code which responds to 0x01 with 0x02. The 'latency timer' on the FTDI IC has been reduced to 1ms, which gives a much faster response time from the computer (about 1.5ms delay).

=== Drivers

FTDI provides the Java D2xx API for Android systems. The API is packaged into a file called d2xx.jar and can be downloaded from http://www.ftdichip.com/Android.htm.

Basic information on the driver software can be found at http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/TechnicalNotes/TN_147_Java_D2xx_for_Android.pdf.

== Microscopes

=== Digital

Digital microscopes are a great tool to have on an electronics workbench. Coupled with a screen, they allow you to look up close at a PCB without having to peer down the sights of a optical microscope.

* Depth-of-field: The larger the depth of field, the less zooming you have to do to get different height components and tracks on your PCB into focus.

== Reflow Ovens

=== The Infamous Puhui T-962 (and variants)

The Puhui T-962 (and T-962A, T-962C variants) are cheap static desktop reflow soldering ovens.

The T-962A has the same design except is a larger unit and provides and effective soldering area of 300x320mm.

|===
| Model Number  | Rated Power | Panel Area | Cost (1, approx.) | Image

| T-962         | 800W        | 180x235mm  | US$200

It appears there are "2020 New Versions" of the above reflow ovens which have exhaust pipe brackets added onto the back so you can clamp on a pipe to vent exhaust fumes.

It is known to produce bad-smelling fumes when in use, especially when it is new. This is because the manufacturer uses aluminium tape and masking tape in the unit which is not designed for high temperatures, which melts!!! It is recommended to replace the masking tape with kapton tape after purchase (see the upgrade section below for more info).

Third parties have made "upgrade kits" for these reflow ovens which aim to to provide better thermal control of the soldering process and improve the UI experience. For example, link:https://www.estechnical.co.uk/products/reflow-oven-controllers?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3KXlo7X_5gIVknZgCh11oAU-EAMYASAAEgIFtfD_BwE[ES Technical provides upgrade packages] for both the T-962 and T-962A. link:https://github.com/UnifiedEngineering/T-962-improvements[UnifiedEngineering redesigned the firmware] to run on the existing microcontroller, with the hardware addition of a temperature sensor for cold junction compensation.

Clones? The Atten AT-R3028 looks VERY similar to the T-962.

== Thermal Cameras

Thermal cameras are great tools to have in an electronics lab for inspecting the thermal behaviour for PCBs and other electrical devices. They can be used to:

* See how heat spread across a PCB
* Detect if things are getting too hot
* Work out where heat sinking is needed
* Calculate {{% link text="thermal resistances" src="/pcb-design/thermal-design-for-pcbs" %}}.
* Find short-circuits

In the context of hand-held thermal cameras, 80x80 is a small number of pixels, 160x120 is moderate, and 640x480 is a large amount.

=== Parameters

NETD: _Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference_: This is the minimum temperature difference that is resolvable by the camera. You could think of this as the _sensitivity_. It is bad practise to refer to this as the resolution as this will get confused with the pixel (spatial) resolution. NETD of thermal cameras is typically between 100-500mk (100-500m°C). The NETD is measure by pointing the camera at a very stable and uniform black body at a specific temperature. The NETD is the standard deviation of the varying pixel values recorded by the camera over a specific period of time<<bib-movitherm-netd>>.

=== Brands

==== Keysight

Keysight has one range of handheld thermal cameras called TrueIR. Within this range there are 3 separate devices, with the key difference between them being the maximum measurement temperature. They all have a medium resolution of 160x120 pixels.

image::keysight-u5856a-marketing-photo.jpg[width=300px]

A unique selling point of the Keysight TrueIR range is the small minimum focal distance of 100mm (most other hand-held thermal cameras have a minimum focal length of 300-500mm), which makes them especially useful for inspecting PCBs.

The 350C camera (U5855A) starts at about US$2500, going up to US$3500 for the 1200C camera (U5857A).

**Software**

TrueIR Analysis And Reporting Tool

Windows only. Includes ability to stream video from the IR camera when plugged in via USB cable.

==== FLIR

I was not impressed with the FLIR software (called _Fluke Connect Desktop_). It took account registration and email link clicking to even get to the point to be able to download it. I then encountered issues installing it without having and old version of Microsoft Word present (the software was looking for this so it could generate reports).

==== Fluke

==== Optris

.A photo of the Optris Xi 400 spot finder IR camera.

==== Testo

Testo 865: 160x120 pixels, measurement range -20 to 280°C.
Testo 868: 160x120 pixels, measurement range -50 to 650°C.

Minimum focal distance of 0.5m, not so suitable for viewing PCBs.

"SuperResolution" takes the raw infrared pixel resolution of 160x120 and upscales it to 320x240pixels. However I'm not sure how more advanced this is other than just up-sampling the image in the digital realm.

*Software*

IRsoft

==== RS Pro

RS Pro is RS Components self-owned brand.

== Signal Generators

=== Output Voltage Not What You Expect?

Most signal generators have a "Load Impedance" setting. Whilst the signal generator almost always has an output of `\(50\Omega\)`, the signal generator will take this load impedance setting into account and generate a voltage that will result in the set peak-to-peak/amplitude at the output.

However, if this load impedance setting is set to say, 50R, but connected to a high-impedance load (for example, connected straight up to the oscilloscope), you will measure twice the expected voltage at the output!

== Ultrasonic Cleaners 

Fill up with mixture of water and detergent. Standard kitchen detergent will do. Expensive cleaning solutions aimed at the professional electronics market. Do they perform any better?

GT Sonic Ultrasonic Cleaner 6L: Large enough for most PCBs.

Synergy Electronics Ltd, NZ supplier of the GT Sonic range.

=== Components That Don't Like Ultrasonic Baths

* MEMS Oscillators: link:/electronics/components/oscillators#mems-oscillators[Ultrasonic cleaners can cause permanent damage or long-term reliability issues to the MEMS resonator] inside a MEMS oscillator.
* Crystal Resonators (XTALs): The ultrasonic bath could excite a XTAL into a resonant frequency (or harmonic) that causes damage. 32.678kHZ crystals are especially sensitive since they operate at about the same frequency as an ultrasonic bath uses for it's cleaning action. MHz XTALs are far less sensitive.
