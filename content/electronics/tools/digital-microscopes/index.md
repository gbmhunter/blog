## Overview

Digital microscopes are a great tool to have on an electronics workbench. Coupled with a screen, they allow you to look up close at a PCB without having to peer down the sights of a optical microscope.

* Depth-of-field: The larger the depth of field, the less zooming you have to do to get different height components and tracks on your PCB into focus.
