## Overview

Voltage-level translators (and hence, voltage-level translation) refers to the conversion to digital logic signals from one voltage level (e.g. +3.3V) to another (e.g. +5.0V) (the different voltage levels are also called _voltage domains_). It is commonly used to provide communication capability between two ICs which are operating of a different voltage rail. Voltage-level translators are also called _level shifters_<<bib-nexperia-voltage-translators-product-page>>.

Voltage-level translators can also be used to prevent _backfeeding_ (whether or not the two sides of the circuitry are at different voltage levels).

IMPORTANT: Do not confuse voltage-level translation with voltage converters (e.g. linear regulators or SMPS) which are designed to provide power.

## Discrete MOSFETs

The below schematic shows a simple circuit for voltage-level translation using a single MOSFET and pull-up resistors. It supports bi-directional digital signal translation.

**What happens if stem:[V_{low}] is driven?**

If stem:[V_{low}] is driven high, then the gate-source voltage of the N-channel MOSFET (stem:[V_{GS}]) is stem:[0V], and the MOSFET is OFF. This means that stem:[V_{high}] is pulled high by its stem:[10k\Omega] resistor.

If stem:[V_{low}] is driven low, then the gate-source voltage of the N-channel MOSFET (stem:[V_{GS}]) is now stem:[+3.3V], and the MOSFET is ON. This means that stem:[V_{high}] is driven LOW through the MOSFET.

**What happens if stem:[V_{high}] is driven?**

If stem:[V_{high}] is driven high, the body-diode of the MOSFET will be reverse-biased, and OFF. This means that the source of the MOSFET will be pulled to stem:[+3.3V] by the stem:[10k\Omega] resistor, (stem:[V_{GS}]) will be stem:[0V], the MOSFET OFF, and stem:[V_{low}] also high because of it's stem:[10k\Omega] resistor.

If stem:[V_{high}] is driven low, the body-diode of the MOSFET will be forward-biased, and switch ON. This will start pulling stem:[V_{low}] to ground plus the forward voltage drop of the diode (stem:[0V + 0.7V = 0.7V]). As the voltage on stem:[V_{low}] drops, the (stem:[V_{GS}]) of the MOSFET will start to increase, and the MOSFET will soon turn ON. At this point stem:[V_{low}] will be driven fully to ground (0V).

## Dedicated ICs

Plenty of dedicated ICs exist for performing voltage-level translation, from dedicated low-to-high translations, high-to-low, anything-to-anything, and bit widths of 1-bit to 16-bit. `1T` means 1 gate with voltage translation, `45` means 1-bit transceiver with direction control.

### Directionality (Unidirectional, Bidirectional, Auto-directional)

Some have DIR pins. Some have OE pins. Some have auto-direction sensing with no DIR pin.

**How Does Auto-Direction Work?**

Auto-direction voltage-level translator ICs use a clever technique to remove the need for a direction pin to specify which side is an input and which side is an output. They work by driving pins with a weak signal (e.g. a CMOS totem-pole driver but with a stem:[4k\Omega] resistor in series with the output<<bib-ti-txb0104-ds>>) that can be overridden by an external signal.

To fix the problem of these weak drives causing slow edge transitions, one shot timers monitor each side for rising or falling-edges. On a transition, the one shot timers momentarily turn on a strong drive (standard CMOS totem-pole) to create a fast transition. The timer quickly expires, turning of the strong drive and letting the weak drive take over until the next transition.

### Powered Off Protection (IOFF)

Powered off protection is activated when one or more of the power rails is at stem:[0V]. Texas Instruments commonly uses the name stem:[I_{OFF}] to describe this feature.

### Propagation Delay

Generally, you want voltage-level translator ICs to have a low _propagation delay_ (commonly abbreviated as stem:[t_{pd}]). Most voltage-level translator circuits have a propagation delay between 0.4ns (really fast) and 20ns (quite slow, but still fast enough for many applications).
