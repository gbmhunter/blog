== Overview

For regular non-isolated buck, boost, regulators, SEPIC and Ä†uk regulators see the link:[Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) page.]

Isolated SMPS topologies:

|===
| Name          | Advantages

| Flyback       | Requires no inductor (uses the transformer). Simple. Low cost.
| Flybuck       | Higher freq. than flyback (= smaller components/better efficiency).
| Forward
|===

== Flyback Converters

Flyback converters are unique in the fact that they use the transformer as **both a transformer (to provide voltage/current conversion and isolation) and inductor (for storage of energy in it's magnetic field)**. All other isolating SMPSs only use the transformer for voltage/current conversion and isolation, and require a separate inductor on the secondary side for performing the buck/boost regulation. The flyback converter to the most used isolating SMPS topology used<<bib-ti-feedback-loop-design-considerations>>.

At first you may be thinking, but wait, because inductors don't like changes in current, isn't the transformer going to create a huge primary side voltage when the switch is opened? This would be true for a standalone inductor, but because the magnetic field is coupled to the secondary side, the moment the switch opens and the primary-side current stops, the current in the secondary side starts. However, there is still the problem of parasitic inductance. This is a portion of the total primary inductance which is not coupled over to the secondary. This does create a large voltage spike, and has to be dealt with zeners/TVS diodes.

=== Feedback

The TLV431 precision shunt voltage reference in tandem with an optocoupler is a popular way of providing feedback from the secondary side back to a flyback converter.

Flyback converters are used extensively in link:/electronics/communication-protocols/ethernet-protocol/#_power_over_ethernet_poe[Power over Ethernet (PoE) applications].
