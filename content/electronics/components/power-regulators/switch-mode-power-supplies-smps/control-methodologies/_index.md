## Overview

Switching power supplies (PSUs) generally have to have some sort of feedback-based control loop to regulate the output to the desired voltage (or current). This is called the _control methodology_. There are a few important types of control methodologies that we will cover on this page.

Although most of the examples on this page use a buck converter, the control methodologies are similarly applicable to other topologies such as boost converters.

## Voltage Mode Control

_Voltage mode control_ uses a scaled version of the output voltage (e.g. resistor divider) as the feedback.

One big disadvantage of voltage mode control is that the SMPS can only respond to changes once it senses a error in the output voltage and propagates through the entire feedback path. This can lead an unacceptably slow response in systems with fast transients[^ti-sboa187e-current-mode-control].

Another problem with voltage mode control is that the feedback compensation is relatively complex, there are two poles that need addressing. The feedback compensation is also dependent on the input voltage[^ti-sboa187e-current-mode-control].

## Current Mode Control

_Current mode control_ attempts to improve on some of voltage mode controls shortcomings by adding a second, "inner" and fast feedback loop by monitoring the inductor current. The outer feedback loop monitoring the output voltage (like in voltage mode control) is still present (we still need to know what our target is), but rather than this controlling the switch, the output voltage feedback is passed to the current feedback, and the output of the current feedback is what controls the switch.

Because current mode control measures the current by using a small-valued current-sense resistor (and therefore also a small voltage signal, this is to keep power dissipation low), it high susceptibility to noise and voltage transients[^ti-sboa187e-current-mode-control].

### Peak Current Mode Control

_Peak Current Mode Control_ (PCMC) is a specific type of current mode control which **senses the peak current flowing through the inductor**. The peak current through the inductor (and consequentially, the switch) is limited by a control signal `\(i_C (t)\)` which in turn is generated by amplifying the difference between the output voltage feedback and the reference voltage `\(V_{REF}\)`.

The below diagram shows what this looks like during continuous conduction:

The following diagram shows the basic components of peak current mode control for a buck converter:

It's important to notice that the left-hand "op-amp" symbol is an analogue amplifier (output is equal to the difference in the inputs, multiplied by a gain) but the right-hand "op-amp" symbol is a comparator (comparator output is either high or low depending on the sign of the difference in the inputs).

**How Does This Circuit Work?**

1. The feedback voltage from the output resistor divider is compared to `\(V_{REF}\)`. The difference is amplified by the voltage feedback op-amp and fed into the comparator. This is compared with a voltage proportional to the inductor current.
1. At the beginning of a cycle, a short clock pulse sets the output of the SR latch. This turns on the main switch (usually a MOSFET) and the current through the inductor begins rising.
1. The inductor current continues to rise until the the voltage at the `\(+\)` terminal of `\(U2\)` becomes greater than the voltage output from `\(U1\)`. At this point the comparator output goes HIGH and resets the SR latch. Thus the ON part of the cycle finishes, and the switch is turned OFF until another clock pulse arrives at the beginning of the next switching cycle.

Bootstrap/MOSFET drive circuitry is usually needed between the SR latch and the MOSFET to:

1. Provide enough current to switch the MOSFET quickly.
1. If a N-channel MOSFET is used, a charge-pump is needed to provided a voltage rail above `\(V_{IN}\)` to drive the gate when turning it on.

Many off-the-shelf ICs will contain both the switch and the current-sensing directly in the IC, removing the need for a separate `\(R_{SENSE}\)` and associated differential amplifier to measure the current.
