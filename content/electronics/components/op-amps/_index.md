## Overview

At it's most basic level, an operational amplifier (op-amp) is a discrete analogue integrated circuit which acts as a voltage-amplifier with very high gain.

An op-amp's gain can be adjusted with the appropriate external circuitry (the op-amp's internal gain does not change, but the gain of the entire circuit does). This is almost always done for any op-amp that is used as an amplifier. External circuitry can also manpulate the op-amp to act as as a current amplifier.

## Schematic Symbol

An op-amp is commonly drawn on schematics as:

{{< img src="op-amp-basic-schematic-symbol.png" width="335px" caption="The basic schematic symbol for an op-amp."  >}}

You may see this symbol with or without the voltage supply pins `\( V_{S+} \)` and `\( V_{S-} \)`. If they are not present, it is assumed that they are connected up to a power source which should be obvious from the design intent.

* Voltage to current (transconductance) and current to voltage conversions (transimpedence)

## Op-Amp Topologies

### Voltage Follower (a.k.a. Buffer)

A _voltage follower_ (also known as a _buffer_) is one of the most basic circuits you can make with an op-amp.

{{< img src="op-amp-schematic-voltage-follower-buffer.png" width="517px" caption="An op-amp configured as a voltage follower (aka buffer)." >}}

As shown in the above diagram, the output voltage is the same as the input voltage (`\(v_{o} = v_{i}\)`). Well isn't this pointless? No, the key point to a voltage follower/buffer is that it can convert a **high-impedance input into a low impedance output**. Practically, this means that you can now sink/source more current from the output without the voltage changing. Buffers are great for boosting signals that travel across long distances, or for signals which get split and go to many devices (this is called **fan-out**, and is common with digital clock signals).

A simulation schematic for a voltage-follower op-amp is shown below:

{{< img src="simulation-schematic-for-op-amp-voltage-follower-buffer.png" width="382px" caption="A simulation schematic for an op-amp configured as a voltage-follower (buffer)."  >}}

The results of the simulation:

{{< img src="output-voltage-vs-input-voltage-op-amp-voltage-follower.png" width="1400px" caption="The simulation results for an op-amp configured as a voltage-follower (buffer). Note how the output voltage mirrors the input voltage exactly."  >}}

### Non-Inverting Amplifier

A op-amp in the non-inverting amplifier configuration is shown below.

{{< img src="op-amp-schematic-non-inverting-amplifier.png" width="508px" caption="An op-amp configured as a non-inverting amplifier."  >}}

The equation for the gain of the non-inverting amplifier is:

<p>$$ v_o = (1 + \frac{R_f}{R_i} ) v_i $$</p>

Notice the `\(1\)` in the gain equation? This means that no matter what you set the resistors `\(R_f\)` and `\(R_i\)` to, you can **never get a gain which is less than one**. This is one of the disadvantages of the non-inverting amplifier (you can have a gain of less than one with an inverting amplifier).

Here is a simulation schematic (circuit) for a non-inverting op-amp amplifier running from a single-ended supply. Because R1 (`\(R_f\)`) and R2 (`\(R_i\)`) are both `\(1k\Omega\)`, the op-amp has a gain of:

<p>
$$ G = 1 + \frac{R_f}{R_i} \\  
G = 1 + \frac{1k\Omega}{1k\Omega} \\  
G = 2 $$
</p>

{{< img src="non-inverting-op-amp-amplifier-simulation-schematic.png" width="465px" caption="The simulation schematic for a non-inverting op-amp amplifier."  >}}

The results of the simulation are shown below. As you can see, the output voltage `\(V_{out}\)` is exactly twice the input voltage `\(V_{in}\)`.

{{< img src="vout-vs-vin-non-inverting-op-amp-amplifier-gain-of-2.png" width="1700px" caption="A graph of Vout vs. Vin for a non-inverting op-amp amplifier circuit."  >}}

### Inverting Amplifier

A op-amp amplifier in the inverting configuration is shown below:

{{< img src="op-amp-schematic-inverting-amplifier.png" width="473px" caption="An op-amp configured as an inverting amplifier."  >}}

The equation for the gain of an inverting amplifier is:

<p>$$ v_o = - \frac{R_f}{R_i} v_i $$</p>

The negative sign is to show that the output is the inverse polarity of the input. Notice that, unlike the non-inverting amplifier, **an inverting amplifier lets you obtain a gain of less than 1**.

Below is the schematic used for simulating the behaviour of an inverting op-amp. Note how is requires a negative voltage power supply.

{{< img src="inverting-op-amp-simulation-schematic.png" width="584px" caption="A schematic for simulating the behaviour of an inverting op-amp."  >}}

And below are the simulation results for the above schematic:

{{< img src="vout-vs-vin-inverting-op-amp-gain-neg-1.png" width="1420px" caption="Vout vs. Vin for an inverting op-amp with a gain of -1."  >}}

### Differential Amplifier

A differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two electrical signals.

{{< img src="op-amp-schematic-differential-amplifier.png" width="489px" caption="An op-amp configured as a differential amplifier."  >}}

The output voltage is given by the equation:

<p>$$ v_o = \frac{R_4}{R_3 + R_4}(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1})v_2 - \frac{R_2}{R_1}v_1 $$</p>

Below is a schematic for simulating the behaviour of a differential op-amp:

{{< img src="differential-op-amp-simulation-schematic.png" width="822px" caption="A schematic for simulating the behaviour of a differential op-amp."  >}}

This schematic produces the following results:

{{< img src="differential-op-amp-simulation-graph-vin1-vin2-vout.png" width="1686px" caption="A graph Vout vs. Vin1 and Vin2 for a op-amp configured as a differential amplifier."  >}}

### Integrator

It's output voltage is proportional to the integral of the input voltage w.r.t. time. The figure below shows an **ideal** op-amp based integrator.

{{< img src="op-amp-schematic-ideal-integrator.png" width="491px" caption="An op-amp configured as an ideal integrator."  >}}

However, this circuit is normally not practical in real world situations. Any errors such as the output offset voltage and input bias current (which all op-amps invariably have), as well as a non-perfect input signal with small amounts of DC bias, will cause the output to drift, until it reaches saturation.

A way to fix this problem is to insert a high-valued feedback resistor, `\(R_f\)`, to limit the DC gain, as well as a resistor, `\(R_{bias}\)`, on the non-inverting input terminal to compensate for the input bias current.

{{< img src="op-amp-schematic-integrator-non-ideal.png" width="431px" caption="An op-amp configured as a non-ideal (real world) integrator, with feedback resistor Rf to slowly remove DC offset."  >}}

### Transconductance Amplifier

A _transconductance amplifier_ is an op-amp topology which is used to **convert a voltage into a current**. Coincidentally, it is also known as a _voltage-to-current converter_.

A basic transconductance amplifier can be built with an op-amp in a non-inverting configuration.

A transconductance amplifier is useful creating an industry standard 4-20mA (or 0-20mA) current-loop signal. The input voltage can come from something like a potentiometer or microcontroller (coupled with either using a VDAC peripheral or PWM/RC-filter technique to create a variable voltage).

One dis-advantage with this design is that the current output is not ground referenced, that is, ground is not used as the return path for the current. This complicates the wiring.

## Important Variables

Sorted by function.

### Common-Mode Input Voltage Range

The _common-mode input voltage range_ is the range of voltages that can appear at the input to the op-amp and it still work correctly. For standard single-supply op-amps, the typical range is approximately `\(0V\)` to `\(V_+ - 1.5V\)`. Note how it includes the most negative rail `\(V_-\)` (which is 0V for a single-supply op-amp) but only gets within `1.5V` of the most positive rail, `\(V_+\)`

### Input Offset Voltage (Vio)

The _input offset voltage_ `\(V_{IO}\)` is the voltage difference between the two input pins. It is a DC measurement parameter. In an ideal op-amp, the two inputs are always at the same potential, and so the input offset voltage is always 0V. However, real-world op-amps always have some differences in the internal components that make up the op-amps, and thus the inputs are not perfectly identical. For general purpose op-amps, this input offset voltage is somewhere between 0.1-15mV.

For example, the LM324 has a typical input offset voltage of 2mV and a maximum of 3mV, at `\(T_A = 25Â°C\)`[^ti-lm234-datasheet]. "Low" input offset voltage op-amps will have a `\(V_{IO}\)` in the range of 50-200uV. For example, the OPAx196 family of op-amps has a max. `\(V_{IO}: 100uV\)`[^ti-opax196-datasheet].

A non-zero input offset voltage results in gain errors between the input and output of a op-amp.

Input offset voltages vary by op-amp transistor technology. Bipolar op-amps typically have the lowest input offset voltage, followed by CMOS and the BiFET op-amps[^ti-app-report-input-offset-voltage].

### Input Bias Current (Ib+ and Ib-)

The _input bias current_ `\(I_{B+}\)` and `\(I_{B-}\)` describe the currents that flow in and out of the op-amps input pins. In an ideal op-amp, no current flows into/out of the input pins (the op-amp has infinite input impedance). In reality, always some small amount of current will flow. Typical input bias currents range from 1-10nA.

The amount and behaviour of input bias current depends on the op-amp transistor technology. A FET-based op-amp's input bias current will double with every 10Â°C rise in temperature[^analog-devices-input-bias-current].

Input bias currents are a problem because these currents will flow through external circuitry connected to the op-amps inputs. This current when flowing through resistors and other impedances will create unwanted voltages which will increase the systematic errors.

The _input offset current_ `\(I_{OS}\)` is the difference between the input bias current at the `+` pin and the `-` pin.

### Input Impedance

The input impedance is the internal resistance to ground from the two input pins. In an ideal op-amp, this value is infinite. For most op-amps, this value is somewhere between 1-10MÎ©.

### Gain-Bandwidth (GBW) Product

The gain-bandwidth product can be initialised as _GBWP_, _GBW_, _GBP_ or _GB_. It is an important parameter which basically puts a limit on the maximum gain and frequency. **An op-amp's maximum possible gain reduces as the frequency of the signal increases.** The multiplication of the gain with the frequency gives the gain-bandwidth product, which is **relatively constant** for a particular op-amp.

Hence if the gain bandwidth of a particular op-amp is 1Mhz, and the gain is 10, the maximum frequency that the op-amp can operate linearly at (still provide a gain of 10) is at 100kHz. Or if the gain was set to 100, then the maximum frequency is 10kHz. **This also means that an op-amp has a built-in low-pass filter, as the gain drops for very high frequencies.**

An example of an ultra-high gain bandwidth is 1700MHz, which are present in 'Wideband CFB" op-amps, designed for applications such as RGB line drivers (such as the OPA695). A 'normal' GBW can be anywhere between 100kHz and 10MHz. A low gain-bandwidth is around 1kHz (reminiscent of less advanced, older op-amps). **Remember gain is unit-less (V/V), so gain bandwidth is expressed as a frequency only.** Not realising this can be confusing! The GBW product is closely related to the slew rate (see below).

### High Level Output Voltage

The high level output voltage (`\(V_{OH}\)`) defines the highest voltage which the op-amp can drive the output to (with respect to the power supply `\(V_+\)`).

### Low Level Output Voltage

The low level output voltage (`\(V_{OL}\)`) defines the lowest voltage which the op-amp can drive the output to. The LM324 is rumoured to only be able to drive the output near ground if it is sourcing current, but only to 0.5V minimum if sinking (see this EDA Forum post, [LM324 Opamp Gain Instability](http://www.edaboard.com/thread209783.html)).

### Slew Rate

Slew rate is another op-amp parameter. It defines the maximum rate the voltage can change with respect to time. In an ideal op-amp, this would be infinite. It has the SI units V/s, and is commonly expressed in uV/s. It can be thought of as the slope of the output waveform if one of the inputs of the input was subjected to a step voltage change. This parameter usually increases as the GBW increases.

### Supply Current

The supply current is generally constant for any supply voltage. It is normally rated as the no-load current. Obviously, if there is a load on the op-amp, the current through the power pins will be the sum of the no load 'supply current' and the current going through the load.

Supply currents for standard op-amps are typically between 1.5-4mA. A 'low-power' op-amp has a typical supply current between 0.5-1.5mA (such as the LM258N). Then there are ultra-low power op-amps that only draw 5-20pA (such as the LMC6464). You normally sacrifice slew-rate and gain-bandwidth for ultra-low power.

## Cascading Op-Amps

Cascading op-amps is concept when the output of one op-amp is connected to the input of another. There can be an arbitrary number of op-amps in the cascade, but usual limits are 3-4.

For a fixed-gain, cascading op-amps can also be used to **increase the bandwidth**, as each individual op-amp now can operate at a lower gain and therefore has a larger bandwidth as defined by the gain-bandwidth product. Note though that each additional op-amp added to increase the bandwidth gives diminishing returns. Also important to note that op-amp bandwidth is defined as the -3dB gain points. Hence the bandwidth does not stay the same (total bandwidth gets smaller) when two identical op-amps are cascaded, as these will now the -6dB points. A practical limit for fixed-total-gain increased-bandwidth cascading is about 3-4 op-amps.

### The Gain

When cascading op-amps, the total gain is the product of all of the individual op-amps gains, i.e.:

<p>$$ A_{total} = A_0 A_1 A_2 ... A_n $$</p>

### The Bandwidth

The bandwidth of cascaded op-amps is not as simple to calculate as the gain.

If all of the op-amps are identical, then the following equation can be used:

<p>$$ BW_{tot} = BW \times \sqrt{2^{\frac{1}{N}} - 1} $$</p>

<p class="centered">
    where:<br>
    \( BW_{tot} \) = the total bandwidth of the cascaded op-amp system<br>
    \( BW \) = the bandwidth of the individual op-amps (remember, they have to be identical)<br>
    \( N \) = the number of op-amps in the cascaded system<br>
</p>

The above equation gives diminishing returns with every additional op-amp added.

## Feedback Resistor Values

As a rule-of-thumb, you should use the lowest acceptable resistances in op-amp feedback paths to reduce instabilities.

## Types Of Op-Amps

### General Purpose

General purpose op-amps typically have parameters in the following ranges:

* Gain Bandwidth Product: 1MHz
* Input Bias Current: 15pA
* Input Voltage Offset: 1mV
* Output Current: 20-50mA
* Icc: 1mA

### Rail-to-Rail Op-Amps

A _rail-to-rail_ op-amp is an op-amp which supports input voltages **near** the power rails, and can drive the output close to the power rails. We must stress the word **NEAR**, as the op-amp's output voltage will never get exactly to the rail, due to the finite voltage drop across the output-stage transistors. Rail-to-rail op-amps just support wider ranged input voltages and can drive closer to the rails than general purpose op-amps can. Look for the **low level output voltage** (`\(V_{OL}\)`) parameter in the op-amp's datasheet. For "rail-to-rail" op-amps, this will usually be about 100-200mV about ground at normal load currents.

{{% warning %}}
"_Rail-to-rail_" op-amps cannot really output either rail voltage, just closer to it that general purpose op-amps.
{{% /warning %}}

This also means that a rail-to-ral single-supply op-amp cannot output 0V. **To achieve a true ground output, you need a negative voltage supply.** There are dedicated ICs designed to provide a small negative power supply to op-amps so that they can output true ground. One such example is the [Texas Instruments LM7705](http://www.ti.com/product/LM7705), a "_Low Noise Negative Bias Generator_". This IC only generates -230mV, which allows the designer to use CMOS-based op-amps which usually have a maximum supply voltage of 5.5V.

## Isolation Amplifiers

Isolation amplifiers provide galvanic isolation between the input (sensor) and output (measurement circuitry). They are used to protect the sensor measurement and recording circuitry (e.g. a microcontroller with on-board ADC) from dangerously high voltages at the sensor, and also the opposite, to protect the sensor environment from potentially dangerous voltages on the rest of the system.

{{< img src="fully-differential-isolation-amplfier-ti-amc1200-simplified-schematic.pdf.png" width="753px" caption="A simplified schematic of the Texas Instruments AMC1200, a fully-differential isolated amplifier. Image from http://www.ti.com/." >}}

A common application would be to isolate and amplify the voltage across a current-sense resistor on a high-power motor, or to protect humans with medical sensors connected to them from the measurement system.

Basic isolation amplifiers require two power supplies (one for each side of isolation), while others incorporate built-in transformers so that you only have to provide one power source.

## Input Resistors

One of the first things you learn about an op-amp is that the input impedance on the input pins are very large (ideally infinite). So naturally you would start to question why resistors would be connected to the input pins of an op-amp like shown in the diagram below:

{{% img src="op-amp-input-pin-resistors.png" width="500px" caption="Schematic showing a resistor on the positive input to a op-amp." %}}

These input resistors serve to limit the input current if the voltage on the input pin goes above `\(V_{CC}\)`. Most op-amps have protection/clamping diodes from the input pins to `\(V_{CC}\)` (typically you can determines this if in the datasheet the input pins max voltage is rated to `\(V_{CC} + 0.3V\)`, which is one diode voltage drop). If there was no resistor there, the built-in diode would conduct and sink a large current from the input pin to `\(V_{CC}\)`, possibly damaging the op-amp. The resistor limits this current to a safe value.
