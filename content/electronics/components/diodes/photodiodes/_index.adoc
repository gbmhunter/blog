## Overview

A photodiode is a two terminal component which converts light into an electrical current. Just like a link:/electronics/components/diodes/[general-purpose diode], they consist of a normal semiconductor PN junction (or PIN junction). The difference is the photodiodes semiconductor junction is exposed to light through a transparent window rather than encapsulated in opaque material as in a standard diode.

## Schematic Symbol


[[photodiode-schematic-symbol]] shows the common schematic symbol used for a photodiode.
