## Overview

A photodiode is a two terminal component which converts light into an electrical current. Just like a link:/electronics/components/diodes/[general-purpose diode], they consist of a normal semiconductor PN junction (or PIN junction). The difference is the photodiodes semiconductor junction is exposed to light through a transparent window rather than encapsulated in opaque material as in a standard diode.

Uses:

* Light sensors
* MOSFET gate drivers in opto-couplers

## Schematic Symbol

<<photodiode-schematic-symbol>> shows the common schematic symbol used for a photodiode.

TIP: The photodiode schematic symbol is very similar to one for an link:/electronics/components/diodes/light-emitting-diodes-leds/[LED (light-emitting diode)], but the "light arrows" on an LED point away from the diode.

## Basic Photodiode-based Transimpedance Amplifier Circuit

Photodiodes are commonly used to measure light intensities. But the output of a photodiode is a very small current, which isn't very useful for measuring. A common "analogue front-end" to add to a photodiode is a _transimpedance amplifier_ using an link:/electronics/components/op-amps/[op-amp], as shown in <<simple-transimpedance-photodiode-circuit>>. The transimpedance amplifier converts the very small current into a much larger voltage. This voltage can then be used to control other parts of a circuit or can be fed into an ADC for digitizing before being read by a microcontroller.

Because the op-amps non-inverting is tied to ground, the inverting input is a "virtual ground" (it also stays at 0V). Because the diode current stem:[I_D] has no-where to go but through the resistor stem:[R_f], this gives the simple equation:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
V_{OUT} &= I_D R_f
\end{align}
++++

TIP: Remember that the op-amp will drive it's output to whatever voltage is needed to keep it's inverting input at the same potential as it's non-inverting input (0V).
