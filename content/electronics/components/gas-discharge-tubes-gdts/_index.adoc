== Schematic Symbol and Designator

.Schematic symbol and designator for a gas discharge tube (GDT).

TIP: You may assume the dot in the schematic symbol indicates a polarity. But simple 2-pin gas discharge tubes are typically polarity insensitive, and the dot signifies that the device is gas filled (usually at some pressure lower than 1 atmosphere). 

I have noticed the following designators used for gas discharge tubes:

* GDTx (Gas Discharge Tube)
* SAx (Surge Arrestor)
