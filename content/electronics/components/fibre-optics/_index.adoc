## Overview

_Fibre optics_ is a digital communication method by sending light (both visible or "light" outside our visible spectrum) down transparent fibres. They are typically used instead of electrically conductive cables when:

* Transmission distances are large, and standard copper cables would give too much attenuation.
* The EMI generated by standard cables would be too high (fibre optic cables don't really radiate any EMI!)
* The transmission speed of copper is too slow.

_Simplex_ cables only have one fibre optic strand, meaning one-way communication. _Duplex_ cables have two fibre optic strands, allowing two-way communication. Duplex cables are usually constructed in a zip-cord fashion so you can easily split them apart at the ends to terminate into separate transmitters and receivers.

Some fiber optic transmitter/receiver pairs are DC-coupled, which extends the bandwidth right down to DC, whilst others are not, and impose a minimum switching frequency on the digital data.

## Standards

### TOSLINK

Basic fibre-optic standard designed for transmitting audio using 1mm plastic fiber. Uses visible red LEDs (at 650nm) which means you can easily see when it's working (and which end is the transmitter).

TOSLINK components are becoming harder to find these days, although TOSLINK patch cables can usually be found at places which sell TVs, computers and other audio/video equipment (TOSLINK being used to transmit audio).

### Versatile Link (VL)

_Versatile Link_ (VL) was first introduced by Hewlett-Packard.

Field-installable connections are relatively simple with Versatile Link connectors. For example, the Avago AFBR-4526Z and AFBR-452BZ duplex connectors show in their datasheet a four-step process involving cutting the fibre (with simple wire cutters), fitting the cable into the connector housing, trimming and polishing (polishing is optional, using a purpose-made fibre holding tool and various grit sand paper), and final finishing<<bib-avago-afbr-4526z-ds>>.

Development kits such as the HFBR-0410Z shown in are available for quick prototyping with with fibre-optic system. Note that the dev kit does not come with any cable!

The LC connector was first developed by Lucent Technology for telecommunication applications<<bib-fiber-optic-solutions-lc-fiber>>.
