## Overview

**M8 and M12 connectors are circular connectors with a 12mm mating thread** (note the thread in question is the thread joining the two mating connectors together, not the other threads which may be present on the M12 connector, such as panel-mount variants which typically have a 16mm thread for mounting to the panel). They are used for a variety of purposes across a large number of industries. A large number of these connectors are rated IP67 and prevent the ingress of water and dust.

M8/M12 connectors have different _codings_. Each coding is a particular pin arrangement and key which prevents the same diameter and pin connector being mated with connectors with different codings.

* A: Sensors, DC power (deprecated use), 1Gbit Ethernet. This is a very common/popular encoding.
* B: PROFIBUS
* C: AC power (deprecated)
* D: 100Mbit ethernet
* K: AC power
* L: PROFINET DC power
* N: 
* S: AC power (replacement for `C`)
* T: DC power (replacement for `A` DC power)
* X: 10Gbit Ethernet

Common pin counts:

* 4 (M8, M12)
* 5 (M12, sometimes M8)
* 8 (M12)
* 12 (M12)

Some of the panel mount M12 connectors have a M16mm panel mount thead, others have a PG9 (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzergewinde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzergewinde)) thread.

## Inline Connectors

They typically have a PG7 or PG9 thread. The PG9 thread seems to be more common/widely available. The inline connectors may have screw termination (terminal block style).

## Splitters

The M8/M12 connector family also come with splitters --- Y and T shaped units which allow 3 cables to be connected together.

## Field Installable Connectors

Some M8/M12 connectors are stated as _field installable_.
