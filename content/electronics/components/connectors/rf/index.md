## Overview

RF connectors are connectors specifically designed to carry high-frequency signals, typically in the 100MHz-30GHz range.

## U.FL

Also known as UMC or XFL connectors.

## Schematic Symbol

There is no "standard" schematic symbol for the male, SMD mount UFL connector, so I normally decide to go with some that is visually resembles the actual connector part, as shown below:

The height of the male SMD connector can vary, but something around 1.2mm is common.
