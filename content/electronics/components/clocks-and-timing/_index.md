<h2>Delay Lines</h2>

<p>Delay lines usually have multiple output pins, each which is connected to a different point in the delay sequence. These are called <i>taps</i>. The number of taps is an important parameter of the delay line.</p>

<p>Delay until first tap, and the incremental delay are also important parameters.</p>
