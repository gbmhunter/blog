## Overview

Potentiometers are variable resistors which are adjusted mechanically. They may be rotational or linear (sliders). They are called **pots** for short. Technically, only the three pronged devices may be called potentiometers (top, bottom and wiper), the two-pronged version which is normally used for higher power applications is called a **variable resistor** or **rheostat**. They not only used for user interfaces, but also as a cheap mechanical rotation to digital converter.

## Resistive Track

The resistive track is most cheap potentiometer is made from graphite. Others may be made from carbon or wound wire.

## Taper

The taper is the relationship between position and resistance. It is also sometimes called the "**law"**.

## Labelling

Potentiometers are labelled according to their resistance value and resistance layout of the track (taper).

## Resistance

The resistance is of potentiometers is easy to read, a usually indicated by a three-digit number and a multiplier. For example, 100K would symbolise a 100kΩ pot.

## Taper

There are two types of taper codes (confusing!).

## Travel (Rotation)

## Partial-turn

Partial-turn potentiometers are the most common and cheapest form of potentiometer. The _total mechanical travel_ (rotation) is usually between 250-330°. The _total electrical travel_ is usually less than this, which means there is some dead-zone and the start and end of the travel in where the resistance does not changed.

Partial-turn potentiometers are commonly used in human-operated situations (the potentiometer is rotated by hand). They provide enough resolution for things such as amplifier volume control.

## Multi-turn

A common number of turns for multi-turn potentiometers is 10. They are usually MUCH MORE expensive than their partial turn counterparts (as of June 2016, US$20 (100) for a "cheap" 3-turn wire-wound potentiometer).

Multi-turn potentiometers are used when more resolution is required, or the "thing" rotating the potentiometer is going to go through 1 or more revolutions (e.g. if the potentiometer was connected to an axle or pulley which rotated back and forth through 4 revolutions).
