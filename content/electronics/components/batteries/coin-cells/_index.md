### Overview

Button cells are also known as coin cells or watch batteries.

## Polarity

The insulated top cap of a button cell is the negative terminal, the base is the positive terminal.

## Internal Resistance

The internal resistance of a coin cell battery starts of at a rather large 10Ω. This then rapidly increases as the batteries energy is consumed. Where high pulse currents are needed, coin cell batteries can be used in conjunction with high-valued capacitors.

A rule of thumb for coin cell batteries is that 10mA is the maximum current draw.

## Technologies

### Silver Cell

Silver cells have a very stable output voltage over the lifespan of the battery.

## Common Types

CR2032. CR2025.

## Dangers To Children

Coin cells are very dangerous to children if swallowed. They can cause severe internal burns due to the chemicals inside of them. Some coin cells have a bitter coating to help prevent children swallowing them, as shown in the below image:

The Duracell coin batteries use non-toxic Bitrex (which is commonly used on other household products such as anti-nail biting solutions) as the bitter substance[^duracell-power-safer].

According to Duracell, the most dangerous sizes are:

* 2016
* 2025
* 2032

(i.e. all the button cells with a 20mm diameter)[^duracell-power-safer].
