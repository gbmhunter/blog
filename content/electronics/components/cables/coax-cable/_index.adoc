## Coaxial Cable

_Coaxial cable_ (or just _coax cable_) is a type of cable consisting of single core surrounded by a circular outer shield, with a insulating dielectric sandwiched between the two. The term _coaxial_ comes from the inner conductor and outer shield sharing the same axis (they are concentric with one another). Coax is most commonly used to transmit high frequency signals over small (oscilloscope probes) and large distances (transatlantic phone cables).

RG-6 is one of the most common types of coaxial cable in residual homes due to it's use with TVs.

### Precision Capacitors From Coaxial Cable

Coax cable has a capacitance of approx. 1pF/10mm, as measured between the central conductor and the outer shield. Precision capacitors for prototype/lab use can be from trimmed lengths of coax. cable.
