## Overview

A _current mirror_ is a circuit designed to "copy" (mirror) the current through one part of a circuit into another. The output current is kept relatively constant even though the load resistance may be dynamically changing.

Current mirrors are used extensively inside analogue ICs such as operation amplifiers (op-amps).
