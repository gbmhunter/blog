## Overview

IGBTs are known for their high voltage and moderate current capability.

## Switching Speeds

Compared to MOSFETs and BJTs, IGBTs are not the fastest at switching between their on and off states.

## Negative Temperature Coefficient

Similar to BJTs, IGBTs have a negative temperature coefficient. This means that their resistance drops as they heat up. This is essentially a positive feedback system in over current situations, which can cause them to blow up very quickly,
