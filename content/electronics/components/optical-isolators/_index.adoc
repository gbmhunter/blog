== Schematic Symbol

A commonly used schematic symbol for an optical isolator is shown below:

Many opto-isolators use a infrared emitting diode optically coupled to a photo transistor, all within a single enclosed component.

## The Current-Transfer Ratio

The current-transfer ratio of a photo-transistor based optical isolator tells you how well it amplifies an input signal to an output signal.

For optical isolators with a single phototransistor driver, the current-transfer ratio is normally in the 20-120% range.

## Phototriac Outputs

Some optical isolators have phototriac outputs instead of the normal phototransistor output. A phototriac is a triac whose gate is controlled by the incoming light source, essentially the same as what a phototransistor is to a transistor.

The outputs of phototriac optical isolators usually go on to drive power TRIACs which switch a mains powered load.

## Component Packages

To achieve good isolation, different-net pins must be kept well away from each other to prevent arcing. This prevents many small-pitch packages from being used for optical isolators.

The two most common packages used for optical isolation components are the through-hole link:/pcb-design/component-packages/dip-component-package[DIP package] and the surface-mount link:/pcb-design/component-packages/soic-component-package[SOIC package].
