## Overview

Common-mode chokes 

Power-line filters?

Find them on DigiKey under [Filters -> Common Mode Chokes](https://www.digikey.co.nz/products/en/filters/common-mode-chokes/839) (CMC).

## Schematic Symbol And Designator

**A common-mode choke is typically drawn as two inductors separated by two lines**. The two lines represent the inductive coupling between the two inductors. A common-mode choke has 4 pins. Typical designator prefixes are `L` (which is also used for a single inductor) or `FL` (for FiLter).
