Circuits emit electrical noise. They emit radiated electromagnetic noise, and conductive noise (noise that travels down any external electrical connections). Many electronic standards define maximum values of noise and disruption that a circuit can emit.

Reduce these levels requires careful circuit design, in both the components used, the layout, the number of layers, and shielding.

== Pre-compliance Testing

Because official compliance testing is generally expensive, in-house _pre-compliance_ testing is a popular way of gaining confidence the DUT will pass once it is submitted for official testing.

=== Attenuators

_Attenuators_ are devices which reduce the power of a signal without distorting the waveform. A note, for what is little-more than a well-tuned and shielded resistor divider, RF-rated attenuators can be expensive (US$100+)!
