## Overview

## PCB Scripting

The library `pcbnew` will be automatically available to you when running the script within `pcbnew`, all you need to do is to `import` it:

```python
import pcbnew

board = pcbnew.GetBoard()
```

Scripts are placed in `<kicad installation dir>/scripting/plugins/`. They then show up in `pcbnew` under _Tools > External Plugins_.
