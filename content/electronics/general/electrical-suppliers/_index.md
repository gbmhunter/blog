The difference is that AliExpress has listed prices for all items, and a built in shopping cart/checkout system which allows you to directly pay the seller from the website. They also offer a secure cash holding service until you confirm the goods have arrived. The goods can be slightly more expensive than on Alibaba, but are still normally very cheap (quality can be questionable though).</td>

**Comments:**

Digi-Key is a huge international supplier. If anyone will have a component, it will be Digi-Key. Although their website isn't that aesthetically pleasing, they have a powerful search interface and display a fair amount of the component properties without having to dig into the datasheets (helpful!). Their pricing is usually a little expensive for one of components, but they are by far the cheapest if you buy in large quantities. I definitely recommend using Digi-Key if you are taking a circuit into production.

Automatic Part List/BOM/Order Creation. This speeds up the ordering process. Directly upload BOMs  as text, csv, or Excel Spreadsheet (.xls) files to DigiKey, select the appropriate columns, and then instantly create orders.

{{< img src="digi-key-automatic-bom-uploading-selecting-excel-columns.png" width="700px" >}}

**DigiKey has a PandA (_Price and Availability_) tool** which allows you to check the pricing and availability for a list of products that you provide either manually in the web form, or by uploading a `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.csv` or `.txt` file.

**Comments:**

NiceGear sells a range of DIY electronics such as Arduino gear, cables and connectors, some components, and tools. The best thing about this electronics supplier is the friendly service and the fast shipping to NZ locations. Surprisingly, NiceGear also undercuts larger suppliers with pricing. For example, in 2013, they were selling the Arduino Due for about NZ$15 cheaper than Element14.

International online component store that stocks most electrical components. As of 09/12/2010 they were offering free shipping around New Zealand.

### Samtec

In my opinion, Samtec has one of the best websites for finding/deciding on electrical connectors. They also have an awesome rapid free sample service, in where you can order samples and they will pay for everything (including shipping), with the goods typically arriving in a few days (and I live in New Zealand!).

## Electronic Manufacturing Service (EMS) Companies

EMS companies specialise in component sourcing, component placing, soldering and general PCB assembly. They don't normally do the PCB design themselves (although some business do both, and others sub-contract this part to another company). A good EMS will support small-pitch components such as 0201s and BGAs (see [Component Packages](/pcb-design/component-packages/)), and have a large number of basic components on hand (such as resistors and capacitors).

### Precision Electronic Technologies

* Location: Australia
* Website: [http://www.precisionet.com.au/](http://www.precisionet.com.au/)
* PCB Manufacturing: Yes

Used to be called Precision Circuits (pre 2012).

### Quick Circuits

* Location: New Zealand
* Website: [http://www.quickcircuit.co.nz/](http://www.quickcircuit.co.nz/)

Helpful and have a good range of experience when it comes to PCB manufacturing. Capabilities include encapsulating/potting.

### SRX Global

* Location: New Zealand, Australia
* Website: [http://www.srxglobal.com/](http://www.srxglobal.com/)

Gone through a series of name changes (used to be Aims, then Startronics, now SRX Global).

### Texmate

* Location: New Zealand. Have not done encapsulation before.

## Specific Components

### Traco Power

[http://www.tracopower.com](http://www.tracopower.com/): Traco Power specialises in power conversion, specifically AC/DC converters, DC/DC converters, and DC/AC inverters. [Element14](http://www.element14.com) stocks a range of their products, including a range of complete DC/DC converters priced from NZ$8-16.

### Molex

[www.molex.com](http://www.molex.com): Molex is one of the industry leaders for electrical connectors. They have a comprehensive set of connectors, from tiny pitched SMD mount connectors all the way up to IP67 rated ethernet connectors. They also have 3D models for most of their connectors (in PRO/E, IGES and STEP formats).

## Hardware

### Hobby King

[www.hobbyking.com](http://www.hobbyking.com): Hobby site that sells anything to do with RC (radio controlled) toys. They sell brushless DC motors (BLDCs), speed controllers, batteries (both Li-Po and NiMH), battery chargers, as well as complete kits. I used this site to buy the motor and associated hardware for the electric skateboard. It should be noted however the first ever Turnigy Li-Po battery I brought from there was defective, as well as a connector on a battery charger being connected around the wrong way, and a faulty ESC card programmer! I was not that impressed. They also take a hard-line on refunds, giving only a 30-day warranty for Li-Po batteries and no refund if they have been tampered with.

### Deal Extreme

[www.dealextreme.com](http://www.dealextreme.com): An American online store that sells selected popular hardware for cheap (along with components). One of the best things about this site is that they offer free international shipping on everything, no matter how cheap the item is!

## Batteries

### Shenzhen Shirui Battery Co.

* Location: Shenzhen, China
* Chemistries: Li-Po
* Support: 4/5
* Price: 5/5
* Range: 4/5

Details: Shenzhen Shirui Battery Co. stock many different sized single-celled Li-Po batteries ranging from 30mAh up to 1000mAh+. In my experience, they have fast response times and more than eager to help (and profecient in English). Datasheets are not included on their website (as with many Asian suppliers), but they will provide them at your request.

### SparkFun

* Location: USA
* Chemistries: Li-Po
* Support: 4/5
* Price: 3/5
* Range: 2/5

Details: SparkFun sells a small range of Li-Po's suitable for small DIY electronics projects.

## OLED Screens
