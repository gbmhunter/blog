## Overview

_RS-422_ (a.k.a. TIA/EIA-422) is a serial, differential communication protocol used for transmitting data. RS-422 uses 2 wires for transmitting and 2 wires for receiving for full-duplex communication. 1 driver and up to 10 receivers can be connected per twisted pair, which is called _simplex multidrop_<<bib-ti-rs-422-rs-485>> (unlike RS-485, which is differential and allows for multiple drivers). It is closely related to the less popular RS-423 protocol. It is also related to the link:/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-232-protocol/[RS-232] (single-ended) and link:/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-485-protocol/[RS-485] (differential) communication protocols.

The maximum allowed differential voltage is stem:[\pm 6.0V]<<bib-wp-rs-422>>.

A _mark_ (binary 1) is transmitted with a negative differential voltage, a _space_ (binary 0) is transmitted with a positive differential voltage. This is the same terminology and "inverse" polarity as RS-232 and RS-485.

## Connectors

The link:/electronics/components/connectors/d-subminiature-d-sub-connectors/[DE-9] is the de facto industry standard connector for RS-422.
