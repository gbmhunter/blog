## Overview

_RS-422_ (a.k.a. TIA/EIA-422) is a serial, differential communication protocol used for transmitting data. RS-422 uses 2 wires for transmitting and 2 wires for receiving for full-duplex communication. 1 driver and up to 10 receivers can be connected per twisted pair. It is closely related to the less popular RS-423 protocol. It is also related to the link:/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-232-protocol/[RS-232] (single-ended) and link:/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-485-protocol/[RS-485] (differential) communication protocols.
