## Overview

RS-232 is a digital data transmission protocol with origins dating back to the 1960's. It was designed as a communication protocol to talk between _DTE_ (data terminal equipment) and _DCE_ (data communication equipment). It is closely related to the link:/electronics/communication-protocols/uart-communication-protocol/[UART communication protocol] provided by most microcontrollers, except that RS-232 uses higher-voltage signalling whilst UART is restricted between `VCC` of the microcontroller and `GND`.

|===
| Drive Type | Single-ended
| Num. Wires (excl. GND) | 2 (TX/RX) or 4 (TX/RX and RTS/CTS)
| Duplexity | Full
| Connection Topology | Point-to-point
| OSI Layers | Layers 1 (physical) and 2 (data link)
|===

RS-232 is commonly used today for a variety of different purposes in embedded systems, incl industrial equipment, test and measurement equipment. RS-232 ports are no longer available on most desktop computers (and certainly not on laptops), but USB-to-RS232 adapters are cheap, popular and easy to use with almost any operating system.

* RS-232C (or just shortened to RS-232)
* EIA-232-D (1987)
* EIA/TIA-232-E (1991)

## Flow Control

The flow control is a way of detecting when the receiver or transmitter is ready to accept or send new data. The UART protocol provides a few (all optional) methods for flow control:

* Hardware RTS/CTS lines
* Software XON/XOFF flow control

### RTS/CTS

This is done by various additional connections to the standard transmit, receive and ground wires. The two most common are CTS and RTS. Typically, a micro-controller may have one or two UART peripherals that support this feature, while the rest are just basic non-flow control UART's.

A small amount of power can be extracted from the RTS and CTS lines for powering low-power devices.

The following tables lists all of the flow control signals (as well as the data signals), with respect to the device in question. Matching signals are grouped together.

|===
| Signal | Port Type | Description | DB-25 Pin | DE-9 Pin

| DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
| Output
| DTE drives this to indicate to the DCE that it is present.
| 5
| 4

| DCD (Data Carrier Detect)
| Input
| DCE drives this when it is connected to the telephone line.
| 8
| 1

| RI (Ring Indicator)
| Input
| The DCE drives this when it has detected a phone call. Note that there is no matching signal going the other way.
| 22
| 9

| RTS (Request To Send)
| Output
| DTE drives this to tell the DCE to get ready to receive data.
| 4
| 7

| CTS (Clear To Send)
| Input
| Driven by the DCE when it is ready to accept data.
| 5
| 8

| TxD (Data Transmit)
| Output
| The DTE sends data to the DCE over this line.
| 2
| 3

| RxD (Data Receive)
| Input
| The DCE sends data to the DTE over this line.
| 3
| 2

| Common Ground (GND)
| n/a
| The common ground for all signals.
| 7
| 5

| Protective Ground (PG)
| n/a
| The protective ground. This is usually just connected up to the common ground on the PCB.
| 1
| n/a

WARNING: There is confusion of how to connect two RS-232 (or UART!) devices together arises when it is not terminal equipment (DTE) connected to modem equipment (DCE). In the embedded world, microcontrollers and other devices which support RS-232/UART can act either as a DTE or a DCE. **Take particular care when connecting RS-232/UART ports together on embedded devices!**

> Rule-of-thumb: Most RS-232 serial interfaces with a male 9 or 25 pin connector are DTE's, most with a female 9 or 25 pin connector are DCE's.

Most often, manufacturers label the UART pins as DTE's. In this case, you have to swap all connections with their matching line. So TxD of device 1 is connected to RxD of device 2, RxD of device 1 is connected to TxD of device 2, RTS of device 1 is connected to CTS of device 2, e.tc.

## Transmission Distances

15m or less

## Higher-Level Protocols

Do you need a higher-level communication protocol that works over a UART connection? See the link:https://github.com/gbmhunter/SerialFiller[SerialFiller] library on GitHub (written in C++). SerialFiller uses a publish/subscribe mechanism and works well on point-to-point serial connections such as UART.

## Interfaces

The pinout of a typical Analog Devices RS-232 to UART transceiver is shown below.

Another example of a RS-232 to CMOS UART converter is the MAX3221IDBE4. It supports an auto-shutdown feature based on the voltage-level of the receiving RS-232 line.

## Driver ICs

### MAX3227

The Maxim MAX3227 is a popular RS-232 line transceiver. It contains 1 driver and 1 receiver as is designed to be driven from CMOS signals (e.g. connected to a microcontroller UART)<<bib-maxim-max32xx-ds>>. Texas Instruments produces a drop-in replacement part for the MAX3227, the MAX3227CDBR (the CDBR standing for commercial temp. range, tape and reeled)<<bib-ti-max3227cdbr-ds>>.

## Cheap Discrete-Part RS-232 To TTL Converter

A RS-232 to TTL logic-level converter can be made out of a few discrete components. The schematic shown below uses some clever circuitry, including a charge-pump like circuit, to generate the negative voltage required for RS-232 transmission back to the computer.
