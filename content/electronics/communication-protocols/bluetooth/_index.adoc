== Overview

The original bluetooth is known as Bluetooth Classic and was designed as a short-range wireless point-to-point communications protocol.

Personal area network (PAN) was called a piconet. 1 central device and up to 7 peripherals.

== Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)

This is a bluetooth standard which supports the streaming of audio between bluetooth-enabled devices.

== Bluetooth 4.0

In 2010, the Bluetooth Core Specification version 4.0 was released. This included Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is now more commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. Bluetooth Smart specifies a hub-and-spoke connection model (with broadcast support), but no mesh topology.

An attribute is a piece of labelled and addressable data. A characteristic is a group of attributes, and a service is a group of attributes.

attribute < characteristic < service

Bluetooth 4.0 uses the server/client paradigm.

== Bluetooth Smart Mesh Working Group

In 2017, a set of three specifications were released by the Bluetooth SIG:

* Mesh Profile
* Mesh Model
* Mesh Device Properties

These specifications allowed Bluetooth devices to form a mesh network. Mesh Profiles use Bluetooth LE for it's underlying radio communications, and as such Mesh Profiles work with Bluetooth 4.2 and Bluetooth 5 devices.

Bluetooth Mesh data packets can be up to 384 bytes.

Two types of encryption keys:

. Network keys: Specific to a physical network.
. Application keys: Specific to the function of the data, e.g. reading sensor values vs. configuring the sensor.
