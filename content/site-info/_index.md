## Site History

### 2004: Blog Started As "Kaboom Pyrotechnics"  

* Name: Kaboom Pyrotechnics
* Domain: [http://homepages.inspire.net.nz/~hunter](http://homepages.inspire.net.nz/~hunter)
* Hosted by: Inspire Net (free)  
* Powered By: Plain HTML

This blog started of called "Kaboom Pyrotechnics". And yup, you guessed it, it solely contained information on how to make fireworks. It was initially designed in [Microsoft Front Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and then in [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver). These were both WYSIWYG editors!

### 2015: Updated To The Wordpress TwentyFifteen Theme

In 2015, in an attempt to simplify the aesthetics of the blog and reduce "clutter", the blog underwent it's biggest design transition --- from a dark-based theme (as shown above), to the custom light-based theme that was loosely based of the stock [Wordpress TwentyFifteeen theme](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/).
