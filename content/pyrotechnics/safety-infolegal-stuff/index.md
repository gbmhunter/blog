## Safety

Pyrotechnics is a very exciting hobby. Part of the reason for this is the inherent danger, as you are playing around with very energetic chemicals that have the potential to burn and/or explode. There are some rules that should never broken in pyrotechnics:

1. Never smoke or have a naked flame around any pyrotechnic compositions.
2. Read through the instructions fully and make sure you understand them before attempting. A background knowledge in chemistry and more importantly common sense is highly recommended.
3. Experiment in small quantities first.
4. Trust no-one. Not even me. Everything you do is at your own risk. You never know who wrote the article
