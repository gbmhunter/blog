## Overview

The `TO-206` (Transistor Outline Package, Case Style 206) component package is a family of large through-hole metal can packages used for things such as transistors. There are variants with anywhere from 2 to 8 leads[^wikipedia-to-18].

Synonyms:

* `H03C`: What National Semiconductor calls the `TO-206AA`[^ti-metal-can-packages].
* `TO-18`

Variants:

* `TO-206AA`: The popular 3-lead variant. Also called `TO-18-3`.
* `TO-206AB`: 3-lead with 1.90mm cap height. Also called `TO-46`.[^wikipedia-to-18] 
* `TO-206AC`: 3-lead with 3.30mm cap height. Also called `TO-52`.[^wikipedia-to-18]
* `TO-206AF`: 4-lead. Also called `TO-72`.
* `TO-71`: 8-lead `TO-18`.

Common Uses

* Diodes (`TO-18-2`)
* Transistors (`TO-18-3`)

## TO-206AA (TO-18-3)

The `TO-206AA` is the most common 3-lead version in the `TO-206` family. It is also known by it's older name as the `TO-18-3` -- or just ambiguously as the `TO-18`. National Semiconductor called this package `H03C`[^ti-metal-can-packages]. Transistors such as the [2N2222A BJT](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/central-semiconductor-corp/2N2222A-PBFREE/4806845) are available in this package.
