## Overview

DO-34 (Diode Outline 34) is a axial 2-lead through-hole component that was common before the advent of SMD technology. It is a hermetically sealed glass package that is used for diodes.

## Synonyms

* ALF2: NXP[^nxp-sod-27-package-info]
* SOD-27: NXP[^nxp-sod-27-package-info]
* SC-40: JEITA[^nxp-sod-27-package-info]

NXP also has a SOD-68 package which they also refer to as DO-34[^nxp-sod-68-package-info]. However, the dimensions of this package align closely with a DO-35 package rather than the SOD-27 which they also label as DO-34.

## Dimensions

Below are the dimensions for the NXP SOD-27 (DO-34) package[^nxp-sod-27-package-info]:

As per the drawing, the body is 4.25mm long and 1.85mm in diameter. This is slightly larger than the [DO-35 package](/pcb-design/component-packages/do-35-component-package/) at 3.5mm long and 1.5mm in diameter.
