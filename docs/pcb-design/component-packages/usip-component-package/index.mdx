## Overview

The `uSiP` package is a _system-in-package_ design used for switch-mode power supplies (SMPS). It is proprietary to Texas Instruments. It uses a PCB base with an embedded SMPS controller IC, connected to an inductor (and optionally, capacitors) mounted to the top surface of the PCB base. Leads are provided as an LGA on the bottom side of the PCB base. All up, this makes a single discrete SMD component that can take part in the reflow process onto a normal PCB design.

Synonyms:

* MicroSiP
* SIL (TI)

Variants:

* SIL0010A (uSIP-10, 3.8x3.0mm)
* SIL0010C (uSIP-10, 3.7x2.8mm)

The uSiP package is used for the TPSM265R1 family of point-of-load power modules (this component incorporates the SMPS buck controller, MOSFET, inductor and some of the capacitors, hence being a complete power modules). It appears there are SIL0010A and SIL0010C variants (same number of pins, but slightly different pitch and package size), but no SIL0010B.

[Manufacturing and Rework Design Guide for MicroSiP Power Modules](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slib006a/slib006a.pdf) has some good advice regarding manufacturing and reworkability of the uSiP (MicroSiP) package.
