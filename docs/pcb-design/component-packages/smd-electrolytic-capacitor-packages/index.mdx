## Overview

The following image shows the package sizes for Panasonic's electrolytic SMD capacitors. These Panasonic cap ranges (there are quite a few series) are commonly used when requiring SMD electrolytics.

The following image shows the recommend land pattern for each of the sizes mentioned above.

The following table shows the relationship between Panasonic standard cap packages (not vibration proof capacitances) and Chemi-Con cap packages.

| Panasonic Code | Chemi-Con Code | Diameter (mm) | Height(mm)
|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------
| A              | B              |               |
| B              | D, D61         | 4.0mm         | 5.8mm
| C              | E, E61         | 5.0mm         | 5.8mm
| D              | F, F61         | 6.3mm         | 5.8mm
| D8             | F80            | 6.3mm         | 7.7mm
| E              | n/a            | 8.0mm         | 6.2mm
| F              | H, Ha0         | 8.0mm         | 10.2mm
| G              | J, JA0         | 10.0mm        | 10.2mm
| n/a            | KE0            | 12.5mm        | 13.5mm

Panasonic has a family of vibration-proof SMD electrolytic capacitors which share the some of the same size codes as their standard range. You have to be careful because the dimensions are not the same between the two product lines. The diameter is always the same (which means you can use a standard footprint for a vibration-proof capacitor, but it's not recommended as the vibration-proof capacitor has a larger "plus" symbol land pattern to better anchor itself to the PCB), but the height of the capacitor is slightly larger in the vibration-proof family (e.g. a standard size `D` has a length of 5.8mm while a vibration-proof size `D` has a length of 6.1mm).

Chemi-Con uses the terminal code `A` for standard capacitors, `G` for vibration resistant capacitors.
