## Overview

DO-204AH (also commonly known as DO-35) is a axial 2-lead through-hole component that was very common before the advent of SMD technology. It was commonly used for small-signal low-power through-hole diodes such as the general purpose 1N414x series and the Zener BZX55 series.

It has a height of 2.28mm when lying horizontally on a PCB.
