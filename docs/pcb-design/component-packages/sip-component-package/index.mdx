## Overview

_SIP_ (Single Inline Package) is a older through-hole component package, commonly used for resistor networks and RAM chips. Similar to the DIP package except there are only one row of pins.

## Resistor Networks

Resistor networks are one of the uses for the SIP package. They are used to save space on the PCB (compared to discrete resistors). The resistors are either isolated or connected to a common bus.

## Dimensions

The SIP package has a pitch of 2.54mm (100mill). It commonly has a pin count of 4 to 24.

## Similar To

* [DIP](/pcb-design/component-packages/dip-component-package/): DIP is the much more popular package with two rows of pins at a 2.54mm pitch.
* [QIP](/pcb-design/component-packages/qip-component-package/): QIP has four rows of pins at a 2.54mm pitch.
