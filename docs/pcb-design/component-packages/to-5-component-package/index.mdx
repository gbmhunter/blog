## Overview

TO-5 (Transistor Outline 5) is an older-style through-hole metal can component package. The traditional TO-92 package has 3 pins, but variants exists with 4, 6, 8 and 10 pins.

The body may have a transparent window (e.g. for phototransistors) or other feature on the top surface.

The diameter of the pin circumference can also vary. Diameters of 0.200" and 0.230" are common.

## TO-5-10

### Synonyms

* H10C: 0.200" diameter P.C., National Semiconductor

## Pin Numbering

The pin numbering is clockwise while looking at the package from the bottom.

## Pin Circumference

The diameter of the pin circumference can vary between TO-5 packages. For example, there is a 8-pin TO-5 package with a pin diameter of 0.200", and another with a diameter of 0.230".

## Sockets

Sockets exist which fit TO-92 packages.

## Similar To

* TO-18
* [TO-39](../to-39-component-package)
* TO-46
* TO-205 (this almost supersedes the TO-5 package)
