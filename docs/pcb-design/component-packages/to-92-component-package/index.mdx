## Overview

TO-92 (Transistor Outline 92) is a very common family of through-hole component packages for low-power through-hole transistors, MOSFETs, and linear regulators.

## TO-92 (TO-226AA)

If a package is just labelled as TO-92, then it is most likely to be the "standard" variant, which is also known as TO-226AA.

### Synonyms

* 29-11: On Semiconductor.
* TO-226AA: JEDEC name for the standard TO-92 package.
* TO-92: If any additional info is missing, it's likely to be the standard TO-92 package.
* Z Package: Analog Devices.

### Dimensions

Mounted height is typically 10mm (including body and enough space to get the through-hole legs mounted in the PCB).

Pitch is variable, depending on how you bend the legs. Commonly adjusted to 2.54mm.

### Thermal Resistance

* $220^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (package only)
* $175^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (plated through-holes)
* $145^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (plated through-holes and $0.25inch^2$ pad per lead)

## TO-92/18 (TO-226AB)

The TO-92/18 variant of the TO-92 package is similar to the standard package (which is just called the TO-92), except that it has a longer body. It is also known as the TO-226AB or TO-92MOD package.

## Pin Numbering

Pin numbering is always done from left-to-right, when the flat side of the TO-92 package is facing you and the legs are pointing downwards, as shown in the following diagram:

This is applicable to both the standard TO-92 (TO-226AA) and TO-92/18 (TO-226AB) variants.

## Standard Pinouts

The pinout for JEDEC-named 2N series transistors is standardised as per the following table:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Pin Number</th>
            <th>BJT Connection</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Emitter (E)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Base (B)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Collector (C)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Heatsinks

There are a limited range of heatsinks available for the TO-92 component package. Aavid Thermalloy makes two TO-92 heatsinks, one of which is currently available (as of May 2016) on [DigiKey](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/575200B00000G/HS251-ND/269309).
