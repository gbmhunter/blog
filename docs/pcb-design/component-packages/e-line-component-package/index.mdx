## Overview

E-Line is a through-hole component package. It is very similar to the common `TO-92` package, except it is a little flatter (e.g. squashed looking). The `TO-92`'s back is semi-circular, while the `E-Line`'s is flat with rounded corners (see the outline and dimensions below). It is footprint compatible with the `TO-92` package.

It is commonly used to house transistors and voltage references.
