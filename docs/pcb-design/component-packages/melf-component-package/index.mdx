## Overview

MELF (Metal Electrode Leadless Face) is a 2-lead cylindrically-shaped SMD component package. It is a hermetically sealed glass-based package, which offers components with superb reliability characteristics[^wikipedia-melf]. However, they are not very popular because they have a tendency to roll around when soldering. Jokingly they can be referred to as "**M**ost **E**nd up **L**ying on the **F**loor".

## Synonyms

* DO-213AB[^wikipedia-melf]
