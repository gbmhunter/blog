## Overview

_TO-252_ (JEDEC Transistor Outline 252) is family of SMD component packages that is commonly used for things such as medium power MOSFETs and linear power regulators. There is a popular 3-lead variant also known as `DPAK`, along with 2 less commonly used 5-lead variants. In the "DPAK" range there is also the larger [TO-263 (D2PAK)](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-263-component-package/) and [TO-268 (D3PAK)](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-268-component-package/) offering higher power dissipation ratings.

All TO-252 packages have a pitch of 1.27mm (50mill). TO-252's are quite easy to hand-solder, although the large tab can make things difficult because of it's heatsinking capabilities.

Features a large tab/pin which can be soldered directly onto the PCB, providing good heatsinking capabilities.

:::tip
If DPAK is referred to by itself, with no pin number indication (e.g. not DPAK3, DPAK5), it is usually referring to the 3-pin version (TO-252-3).

## TO-252-3

The TO-252-3 is the 3-lead variant in the TO-252 family, most commonly known by the synonym DPACK. The image below shows a 3D render of this package.

## TO-252-5-P1

The TO-252-5 is the 5-lead variant in the TO-252 family with a square a shorter tab than the TO-252-5-P2. It is not as common as the 3-lead variant. Most of the time the middle lead (3rd lead) is cut short in this variant, as it's electrically connected to the tab.

**Thermal Resistances**

The thermal resistances for any TO-252-5 package are shown below. 

* $T_{JA} = 59^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (pads only, no copper fill)
* $T_{JA} = 26^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (high-wattage land pattern)
* $T_{JA} = 20^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (one square inch of copper surrounding package, connected to ground)
* $T_{JA} = 7^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (high-wattage land pattern with thermal vias to bottom layer)

## TO-252-5-P2

The `TO-252-5-P2` is a 5-lead variant of the `TO-252` package with a rounded and longer tab than the `TO-252-5-P1`[^nisshinbo-to-252-5-p2]. If there is no suffix listed on a `TO-252-5` package (e.g. no mention of `P1` or `P2`), it will likely be this variant. The image below shows a 3D render of this package.
