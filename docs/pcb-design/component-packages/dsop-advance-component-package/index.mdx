_DSOP (Dual-side Cooling SOP) Advance_ is a SMD component package used by Toshiba that has thermal pads on both the underside and topside of the package. It has a pin count of 10 (8 if you don't count the two pins by themselves) and a pitch of 1.27mm (50 mil).

## Synonyms

* 2-5S1A: Toshiba.
* DSOP-Advance-8: Mouser[^mouser-dsop-advance-8].

## Thermal Resistance

The DSOP Advance comes with dual-side cooling features to further decrease the thermal resistance compared to the SOP Advance component package.

## Dimensions

The package is 5x6x0.73mm, including the leads (nominal).
