## Overview

The `PowerPAK SO-8` package is designed with the same pin spacing as the SO-8 package, except with pins 5-8 connected together with an additional thermal pad on the underside of the package. Although it is recommended to design a special footprint for this package to take advantage of the thermal pad, it can be soldered onto existing SO-8 land patterns[^bib-vishay-si7846dp].

Pin Count: 8[^bib-vishay-si7846dp]

Pitch: 1.27mm[^bib-vishay-si7846dp]

Solderability: Reflow is required. Not possible to solder with iron as package has a large thermal pad on the underside, and a very small amount of the pads are exposed.

Thermal Resistance: $R_{\theta JC}=1^{\circ}C/W$[^bib-vishay-si7846dp]

Package LxWxH: 6.05x5.05x1.04mm[^bib-vishay-si7846dp]

Typical PCB Land Area: $29.2mm^2$ ($6.61x4.42mm$)[^bib-vishay-si7846dp]

Common Uses:
* MOSFETs
