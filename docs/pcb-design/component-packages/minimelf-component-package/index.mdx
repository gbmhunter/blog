## Overview

`MiniMELF` is a cylindrical, 2-lead SMD component package whose most common use is for packaging diodes and resistors. This package often comes under the alternative names _SOD-80_ or _DO-213AA_. I prefer to call it MiniMELF as it's to remember when there are a plethora of other packages under the "SOD" or "DO-" naming convention.

MiniMELF (and all the other packages in the MELF family) are cylindrical shaped components. This makes them somewhat infamous because they have a tendency to roll around when soldering. This leads to the backronym "MELF: **M**ost **E**nd up **L**ying on the **F**loor" or being called the "roll away" package. However, they remain popular because offer significant advantages over traditional SMD packages including:

* High accuracy
* Moisture resistance
* High-temperature operation

* 100H01: IEC package outline code[^bib-nexperia-sod80c-package-info].
* DO-213AA
* LL-34: Littelfuse[^bib-littelfuse-ll-34-thermistors-ds].
* LL34: Microsemi[^microsemi-bzv55-ds].
* LLDS (Nexperia[^bib-nexperia-sod80c-package-info])
* SOD-80 (Small-outline Diode 80)
* SOD-80C (Nexperia[^bib-nexperia-sod80c-package-info])

Pitch: 3.2mm (distance between terminal centers)

Solderability: Easy to solder by hand, but doesn't stay in one place! Can also be wave or reflow soldered.
