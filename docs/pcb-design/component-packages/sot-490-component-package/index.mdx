## Overview

The `SOT-490` (Small-outline Transistor 490) is a 3-lead SMD component package primarily used for transistors. It is very similar to the [SOT-416FL component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-416-component-package/) used by Rohm Semiconductor, which also used the JEITA name `SC-89` for the `SOT-416FL`.

`SOT-490` (`SC-89-3`) has the same package dimensions as the `SC-89-6`, but just with half the leads missing (similar to the `SOT-23-3` vs. `SOT-23-6`).
