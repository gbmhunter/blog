## Overview

`SOD-882` (Small-outline Diode 882) is a 2-lead SMD component package.

Synonyms:

* DFN1006-2 (NXP[^bib-nexperia-sod-882])

Similar To:

* [DFN](/pcb-design/component-packages/dfn-component-package/)
* [SOT-883](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-883-component-package/) (3 pins in the same sized package, used for transistors)

Pitch: 0.65mm[^bib-nexperia-sod-882]

Solderability: Reflow is most suitable.

Thermal Resistance:

* 500K/W (standard footprint)[^bib-nexperia-pzuxbl-ds]
* 250K/W (standard footprint, but with 1cm2 pad for cathode)[^bib-nexperia-pzuxbl-ds]
* 55K/W (thermal resistance from junction to solder point)[^bib-nexperia-pzuxbl-ds]

Package Dimensions:

* Length: 1.02mm (max)[^bib-nexperia-sod-882]
* Width: 0.62mm (max)[^bib-nexperia-sod-882]
* Height: 0.50mm (max)[^bib-nexperia-sod-882]

Typical PCB Land Area: $1.17mm^2$ (1.30x0.90mm)[^bib-nexperia-sod-882]

Common Uses:

* Zener diodes[^bib-nexperia-pzuxbl-ds]

The `SOD-882` component package is quite different from many other SOD packages (such as `SOD-323`, `SOD-523`) in that it's pads are on the underside of the package rather than gull-wing or flat leads (when the `F` suffix is used). This makes the `SOD-882` very similar to a standard DFN package.

It is also very similar to the [SOT-883 component package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-883-component-package/) (note: that's SOT, not SOD!). It has the same outside dimensions as the `SOT-883`, except with only 2 pads instead of 3. This presumably explains the transition from `SOD` to `SOT` -- the two pin package is used for diodes, whilst this three pin package is used for transistors.
