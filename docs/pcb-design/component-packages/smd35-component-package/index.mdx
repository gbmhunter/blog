## Overview

SMD35 is a 2-lead SMD package used exclusively by Seti for their range of Deep UV LEDs.

You can solder this by hand, due to the pins running up the side of the package for a short distance.

Thermal Resistance: 200mW is the maximum power this package can dissipate before you have to consider special PCB footprint designs.

Dimensions:

* WxLxH = 3.50x3.50x0.80mm
* Land Area = 12.25mm2 (3.50x3.50mm)
