## Overview

TO-273AA (Transistor Outline 273AA) is a through-hole component package.

The TO-273AA (also known as the Super-220) can be considered a variant of the TO-220 which replaces the screw-mounted design of the TO-220 with a clip-mounted design. Because of the clip, this package can usually achieve lower junction-to-ambient thermal resistances, hence the "Super". It is used by International Rectifier.

## Synonyms

* Super TO-220: International Rectifier.

## Dimensions

Pitch is 2.54mm (100mil).

Height is approx. 20.5mm when mounted vertically, with pins pushed into PCB until they hit the taper.

## Thermal Resistance

* $T_{JC} = 0.7^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$
* $T_{JA} = 60^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (min. PCB footprint)
* $T_{JA} = 35^{\circ}{\rm C}/W$ (1" sq. PCB footprint)

All of the above values are from the IPS0551T MOSFET datasheet[^ir-ips0551t-mosfet-ds].

## Similar To

* [TO-220](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-220-component-package/): TO-220 is a more popular screw-mounted package that looks like this TO-273AA.
