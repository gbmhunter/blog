## Overview

SOT-323 (Small-Outline Transistor 323) is a small family of SMD component packages.

Just like the [SOT-23](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-23-component-package/), there are 3, 5, 6, and 8 lead variants in the SOT-323 package family:

* SOT-323-3 (3 lead)
* SOT-323-5 (5 lead)
* SOT-323-6 (6 lead)
* SOT-323-8 (8 lead)

All of the variants on the SOT-323 family have a typical body width of 1.25mm and a body length of 2.0mm[^nxp-sot-323] [^analog-devices-sc6-package] [^analog-devices-sc8-package]. The width including the leads is 2.1mm. All variants except the SOT-323-8 have a pitch of 0.65mm. The SOT-323-8 has a pitch of 0.5mm (this is needed to fit all the pins on the side of the body without changing the body length). Again, this is similar behaviour to the SOT-23 package family.

If the pin number isn't specified, it is likely to be the 3 pin variant (this is the most common). The SOT-323 package has a significantly smaller PCB footprint than the [SOT-23](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-23-component-package/).

## SOT-323-3

SOT-323-3 is the 3 lead variant in the SOT-223 family. This package is also commonly known by it's EIAJ name `SC-70`. It is commonly used for discrete semiconductors such as diodes, transistors, and voltage regulators.

### Synonyms

* SC-70: EIAJ[^nxp-sot-323].
* SCx: Analog Devices.
* SMini3-G1-B: Panasonic.
* SOT-323: If the pin number isn't specified, it is likely to be the 3 pin variant (this is the most common).
* SOT-323-3.

### Dimensions

### Recommend Land Pattern

The occupied PCB area of the SOT-323-3 is $ 6.23mm^2\ (2.65mm \times 2.35mm) $ when included with the recommended reflow PCB footprint above.

### Thermal Resistance

* $ T_{ja} = 380°C/W $ (mounted on 10x8x0.6mm FR4, still air)
* $ T_{jc} = 60°C/W $

## SOT-323-5

SOT-323-5 is the 5 lead variant in the SOT-323 family.

### Synonyms

* SC-70-5: EIAJ.
* SOT-323-5.

### Dimensions and Land Pattern

## SOT-323-6

SOT-323-6 is the 6 lead variant in the SOT-323 family.

:::note
From a few sources I found online, the SOT-323-6 seems dimensionally identical to the [SOT-363 package](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-363-component-package/). However, I have kept a separate page on the SOT-363 since I could not find conclusive evidence that they are identical.

* SC6: Analog Devices[^analog-devices-sc6-package].
* SOT-323-6.

## SOT-323-8

SOT-323-8 is the 8 lead variant in the SOT-323 family. It differs from both the SOT-323-3 and SOT-323-5 in that it has a pitch of 0.5mm rather than 0.65mm[^analog-devices-sc8-package].

### Synonyms

Synonyms for the SOT-323-8 include:

* MO-203BA: Uncommon JEDEC name[^analog-devices-sc8-package].
* SC8: Analog Devices' name[^analog-devices-sc8-package].
