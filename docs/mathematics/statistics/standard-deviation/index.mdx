## Overview

The standard deviation is a metric which is used to measure the amount of variation in a set of data values.

The standard deviation has the same units as the data.

## Equation

<div>$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{ \sum{(x - \bar{x})?^2}}{n}} $$</div>

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$ \bar{x} $ is the mean (average) of the samples<br/>
$ n $ is the number of samples<br/></p>

For example,

```
4, 8, 7, 3, 12
```

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{x} &= \frac{1}{5} * (4+8+7+3+12)\\
        &= 6.8\\
\\
\sum{(x - \bar{x})} = (4-6.8)^2+(8-6.8)^2+(7-6.8)^2+(3-6.8)^2+(12-6.8)^2\\
                  =                  
\end{align}
$$

## Software

You can calculated the standard deviation of an array in Numpy with `np.std()`:

```python
np.std(my_array)
```

By default, the array is flattened. However, you can specify an `axis` on which to calculate the standard deviation.
