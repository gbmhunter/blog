## Overview

MAHD (Modified Agile for Hardware Development) is a project management methodology aimed at hardware development that is a hybrid of Agile and traditional project management methodologies. The authors recognize the benefits of Agile methodlogies that are very common in software development, but recognize that hardware development has unique challenges (usually due to much slower iteration time to design and build a piece of hardware than it is to write and test a piece of software).

> Hardware is different than software — requirements must be frozen to ship, prototypes cost money,
incremental features impact whole designs, etc. To address these unique needs of physical products,
MAHD rethinks Agile tactics while maintaining the benefits of Agile principles.
