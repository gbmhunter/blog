## Overview

Pumps develop differential pressure. That is, they add to whatever pressure is already at the input.

## Converting Between Head And Pressure

You can convert between head and pressure by using the following equation:

$$ p = 0.132 h SG $$

<p className="centered">    where:<br/>
    \( p \) = pressure | psi<br/>
    \( h \) = head | m<br/>
    \( SG \) = specific gravity of the fluid | no units<br/></p>

Conveniently, The SG for water is 1.

## High Pressure Water Pumps

Typical voltages for high-pressure water pumps are 12VDC, 24VDC, 110VAC, 220-240VAC and 380VAC (three phase).

The pressure of "high-pressure" water pumps ranges from 50-200psi (12-24VDC pumps) up to 1000-3000psi (110-380VAC).
