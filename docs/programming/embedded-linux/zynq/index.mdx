## Overview

**The Zynq is a family of Xilinx FPGAs which incorporate both programmable logic and one or more dedicated ARM Cortex-A9 processors** (because of the inclusion of the processor, it can be referred to as a SoC instead of an FPGA).

## Acronyms

PL - **P**rogrammable **L**ogic. This refers to the programmable FPGA logic (a.k.a. fabric) inside the Zynq-7000.

PS - **P**rocessing **S**ystem. This refers to the Cortex-A9 subsystem inside the Zynq-7000.

## Variants

**There are two main variants of the Zynq**, the Zynq-7000S, a cheaper cost-optimised FPGA (with one Cortex-A9 processor), and the Zynq-7000, the more powerful and expensive FPGA (with more logic cores and dual Cortex-A9 processors).

## Microblaze

Microblaze, a soft-core CPU architecture provided by Xilinx, can be run on the programmable logic inside the Zynq, in addition to the dedicated Cortex-A9 processor.

## The SDK

The Xilinx **S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it (SDK) can be used to design and debug Zynq FPGAs.

## Operating Systems

You can run a number of different operating systems on the Cortex-A9 processor inside the Zynq FPGA. These include:

* [Yocto-based builds](/programming/embedded-linux/yocto-project) (Xilinx provides device and dev board support through [meta-xilinx](https://github.com/Xilinx/meta-xilinx))
* [PetaLinux](/programming/operating-systems/petalinux)
* Ubuntu (limited support, usually with a GUI)
* [Android](/programming/operating-systems/android)
* [FreeRTOS](/programming/operating-systems/freertos)
* [Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/) (the ARM port of Arch Linux)

## meta-xilinx

**meta-xilinx is the Yocto layer provided by Xilinx to build Yocto-based images for the Zynq architecture.**

The device trees are located at:

```text
meta-xilinx/recipes-bsp/device-tree/
```

In particular, zynq7-base.dtsi located at meta-xilinx/recipes-bsp/device-tree/files/common/ could be of particular interest because it defines hardware such as the ethernet, UART, I2C, CAN, USB, ADC e.t.c.
