## Overview

_Opaque pointers_ is a design pattern that can be used to hide implementation details of what is being pointed at. Typically a user for a different place in the code can use as see a pointer to a particular type but cannot see any more details about the type itself

Opaque pointers is commonly used in the C programming language to hide implementation details of a struct (object) from a user, and only operations with the object via a function-based API. It is not as commonly used in C++ because C++ gives you the ability to define `private` and `protected` members of your class, removing the need to implement the same behaviour with opaque pointers.

Likely the most significant **disadvantage to this pattern is that memory allocation must be used in the constructor to create the object**, because the caller cannot create the object since the full size of the type is hidden away from them.

## Example

The below example shows how to use the opaque pointer design pattern to implement a simple "Counter" object (you could think of it as a class). The Counter object is defined in `Counter.h`/`Counter.c` and created/used in `main.c`.

In the header `Counter.h`:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

// Opaque declaration of the counter type.
typedef struct Counter_t Counter_t;

Counter_t *Counter_Init();
void Counter_AddOne(Counter_t *me);
uint8_t Counter_GetCount(Counter_t *me);
void Counter_DeInit(Counter_t *me);
```

And in the .c file `Counter.c`:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "Counter.h"

// Implementation of Counter_t. Hidden from other files!
struct Counter_t {
  uint8_t count;
};

Counter_t *Counter_Init() {
  // NOTE: Memory allocation here! May or not be ok for an embedded
  // project, can be done at initialation time only.
  Counter_t *newCounter = malloc(sizeof(Counter_t));
  newCounter->count = 0;
  return newCounter;
}

void Counter_AddOne(Counter_t *me) { me->count++; }

uint8_t Counter_GetCount(Counter_t *me) { return me->count; }

void Counter_DeInit(Counter_t *me) {
    free(me);
}
```

We can then use this `Counter_t` from other source files like `main.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include "Counter.h"

int main(void) {
    printf("Creating counter...\n");
    // From main.c, we can't access any of the members of the
    // opaque Counter_t struct, we only have a pointer and have to use
    // the provided API in Counter.h.
    Counter_t *myCounter = Counter_Init();

    Counter_AddOne(myCounter);
    uint8_t count = Counter_GetCount(myCounter);
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);

    // Finally, destroy counter
    Counter_DeInit(myCounter);
    return 0;
}
```

Note how in `main.c` we can only create a pointer to the Counter (`Counter_t *`), we aren't given enough information to create a `Counter_t` directly (if we could, then we would be able to access all the internals -- bypassing the public API). If we want to perform operations on it such as adding one or getting the current count, we have to use the API like `Counter_AddOne()` and `Counter_GetCount()`.
