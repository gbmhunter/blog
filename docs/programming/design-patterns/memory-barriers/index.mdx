<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The one rule that compile-time and runtime memory re-ordering follows:</p>

<blockquote>Never modify the behaviour of a **single threaded program**. - Memory re-ordering algorithms</blockquote>

<p>However, if you are designing a multi-threaded program, you are out of luck. Memory re-ordering can mess with what you expect shared data to equal at any point in time.</p>
