## vim Plugin

IntelliJ supports the [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) plugin which adds vim-like functionality to the IDE.

This plugin supports configuration using a `~/.ideavimrc` file, which is similar in format to a typical `.vimrc` file, except that it allows special extensions to directly control IntelliJ through an API.

I have noticed that IdeaVim cannot deal with large files that well (e.g. a 50,000 line `.json` file), and I have to disable the plugin to be able to work with these files.

## Slow Deployment

One problem I have noticed in IntelliJ is the slow upload of files to a server through SSH. Even though IntelliJ was configured to only upload changed files, it was still painfully slow in uploading the 10-20 file changes that occurred whenever I switched between `git` branches. Below is an example of the slow transfer speed as reported by IntelliJ after some local files changed:

```text
[17/03/20, 4:00 PM] Automatic upload completed in 11 minutes: 64 items deleted, 374 files transferred, 14 items failed (9.7 kbit/s)
```

In the end I gave up on using IntelliJ for this and instead used `rsync`, which was about 10-100x faster.
