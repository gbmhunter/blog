title: Visual Studio Version Control With Mercurial
type: page
---

## Overview

Following is an Mercurial ignore file for excluding the unnecessary files from a Visual Studio C# project (written when using the 2010 version, but should work with others). The ignore file is written using regex syntax.

It only excludes files that are within a folder called `<Visual Studio root folder>`. This is to stop the ignore file excluding other files with the same extension from other sections of the repository. Replace `<Visual Studio root folder>` with whatever folder name you choose to put the code in, or delete  `<Visual Studio root folder>/` completely and it will ignore these files anywhere in your repository.

The type of file excluded is commented beside each line, just incase you want to re-introduce some of these files for some reason.

Copy this code into the .hgignore file found in the root directory of your repository.
