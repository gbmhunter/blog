## Interfaces

ARM DSTREAM?

### JTAG

_JTAG_ is a standard defining connections and protocols for testing/verifying PCBs and the devices on them. It is named after the **J**oint **T**est **A**ction **G**roup which defined the standard. It is formally codified in 1990 by IEEE in the standard _IEEE 1149.1-1990_[^bib-wp-jtag]. ICs supporting JTAG expose a _Test Access Port_ (TAP) which the JTAG device connects to, allowing bi-directional serial data transfer. JTAG requires 4 signal lines (ignoring the rarely seen 2-signal variant).

Although JTAG was initially designed for board-level testing and verification to address common soldering faults in the 1980's, it has evolved and is now most commonly used today as an in-circuit programming/debug protocol for microcontrollers, microprocessors, FPGAs, and other similar programmable ICs.

JTAG allows the following:

* Processing halting
* Single-stepping
* Writing to non-volatile memory (programming)

A 2-wire (excluding GND) "reduced pin count JTAG" is specified in IEEE 1149.7[^bib-wp-jtag]. The two wires that are used are `TMSC` (test serial data) and `TCKC` (test clock). This 2-wire variant is not common.

CoreSight is an collection of technologies to allow for the debugging of ARM based SoCs. It includes systems built on JTAG for debugging.

`RTCK` (return clock) is a signal created to use be able to use synchronized TAP controllers in ARM9 and ARM11 cores. It is an output of the target system back to the JTAG adapter and is used for synchronization purposes. The RTCK is usually driven by the last flip-flop in the synchronization chain on the target device. The adapter will not change TCK until it gets back a signal on RTCK, this process is called _adaptive clocking_[^bib-arm-dstream-rtck].

### SWD

_SWD_ (**S**ingle **W**ire **D**ebug) is a two-wire programming/debugging interface for programmable ICs such as microcontrollers. It is a popular alternative to JTAG. It is formally specified in the ARM Debug Interface v5.

        <td>SWCLK</td>
        <td>Output</td>
        <td>Clock output to target device. Frequency selection is up to the host to decide, up to about 60MHz in practice[^bib-kudelski-swd].</td>

        <td>SWDIO</td>
        <td>Bi-directional</td>
        <td>Synchronous bi-directional data.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Whilst officially just a 2-wire interface, it is commonly bundled with 1-2 other signals.

        <th>Name</th>
        <th>I/O (w.r.t. programmer)</th>

        <td>Input</td>
        <td>Target $V_{CC}$ voltage so the adapter knows what counts as a logical 1 and 0 on the other wires.</td>

  </tbody>
</table>

`SWCLK`, `SWDIO` and `SWO` should be pulled high by approx. $10k\Omega$ so that they remain in a stable state when not driven[^bib-arm-dstream-swd-conn].

SWD uses a bus called _DAP_ (Debug Access Port). On this bus there is one master, the DP (Debug Port, typically a USB dongle when programming microcontrollers), and one or more slaves called APs (Access Ports). There are three different Debug Ports[^bib-kudelski-swd]:

. JTAG Debug Port (JTAG-DP): Uses the standard JTAG interface.
. Serial Wire Debug Port (SW-DP): Uses the SWD protocol.
. Serial Wire / JTAG Debug Port (SWJ-DP): A combination of the previous two, this port can either use SWD or JTAG to access the DAP bus. The `TCK` and `TMS` JTAG signals are re-used for the SWD `SWCLK` and `SWDIO` signals.

ARM specifies the following two Access Ports:

. Memory Access Port (MEM-AP): Provides access to core memory and registers.
. JTAG Access Port (JTAG-AP): Provides access to a JTAG chain from the DAP.

WARNING: Not all microcontrollers connect `SWCLK`/`SWDIO` up to the main VDD voltage domain. For example, in STM32F07x/04x devices, the `SWCLK` and `SWDIO` pins are supplied by the `VDDIO2` domain, so make sure to connect the right pins up to `VTREG`.

### SWV

_Serial Wire Viewer_ (SWV) is the protocol used by the `SWO` pin on the `SWD` connector[^bib-code-inside-out-swv]. It is only available for ARM Cortex-M3 cores and higher, it is NOT available on Cortex M0 or M0+ cores.

32 available ITM stimulus ports. ARM recommends[^bib-code-inside-out-swv]:

* Port 0 is used for text data (e.g. data from `printf()`)
* Port 31 is used for RTOS event data
* All other channels are up to the user to decide.

SWV can give you `printf()` style debugging output, in where the `printf()` function calls the CMSIS `ITM_SendChar()` function.

### ETM

4-bit.

### Semihosting

_Semihosting_ is an ARM feature which allows an ARM-based target to communicate with and use the input/output (IO) facilities on the host computer which is running a debugger[^bib-arm-what-is-semihosting]. Semihosting is commonly used to send `printf()` calls on the target to the host, and be displayed whilst debugging through a terminal on the host.

NOTE: ARM processors prior to ARMv7 use the SVC instructions, formerly known as SWI instructions, to make semihosting calls. However, if you are compiling for an ARMv6-M or ARMv7-M, for example a Cortex-M1 or Cortex-M3 processor, semihosting is implemented using the BKPT instruction[^bib-arm-what-is-semihosting].

### Segger Real-Time Terminal (RTT)

The _Segger Real-Time Terminal_ (RTT) provides a bi-directional data transfer mechanism between a host and target microcontroller. RTT emulates a telnet connection on the host machine[^bib-mcuoneclipse-segger-rtt]. For example, to connect to Channel 0 (designed for terminal use), you connect via a Telnet client to `localhost:19021`.

It is currently supported by the following cores[^bib-segger-about-rtt]:

* ARM Cortex-M0/M0+/M1/M3/M4/M7/M23/M33
* Renesas RX100/200/600

Example target-side code to send a message to the host via Segger RTT on Channel 0[^bib-segger-about-rtt]:

```c
int main(void) {
  do {
    SEGGER_RTT_WriteString(0, "Hello World from SEGGER!\r\n");
    _Delay(100);
  } while (1);
  return 0;
}
```

## TagConnect

Segger has jumped on the band wagon and provides a "J-Link 6-pin Needle Adapter" which looks like a re-branded TagConnect to mate with their J-Link programmer.

## Cortex Debug Connector Pinouts

There are industry-standard connector sizes and pinouts for debugging the Cortex range of ARM-based microcontrollers (e.g. microcontrollers with a Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M3, e.t.c.).

### 10-pin, 1.27mm Pitch

The 10-pin, 2x5, 1.27mm pitch (0.050") connector is the most common debug connector used with Cortex-based microcontrollers.

<Image src={require('./arm-cortex-10pin-debug-connector-pinout.svg').default} width="800px">Standard pinout for the ARM Cortex 10-pin programming connector configured for (A) JTAG and (B) SWD. NC pins are **N**ot **C**onnected (i.e. not used)[^bib-keil-coresight-conn].</Image>

The official connector is the [Samtec FTSH-105-01](https://www.samtec.com/products/ftsh-105-01-l-dv-k), yet luckily these header-style connectors are standardized across manufacturers and almost any 1.27mm 2x5 header-style connector will work.

<Image src={require('./samtec-ftsh-105-01-l-dv-k-2x5-1.27mm-header.png').default} width="200px">3D model of the Samtec FTSH-105-01 10-pin 2x5 1.27mm pitch SMD header[^bib-samtec-ftsh-105-01].</Image>

Sometimes `Pin 7` is removed from the male header, and the female header has a blank position in the same location (i.e. no receptacle). This is to "key" the header so it can't be mated incorrectly. Another way of preventing incorrect mating is to use a keyed shroud.

`Pin 9 (GND)` can also be used for detection.

### 14-pin TI Connector

The `EMU0` and `EMU1` pins can be used for cross-core triggering (e.g. one core halts and signals the other cores to halt)[^bib-ti-jtag-conns]. They are not supported by ARM DSTREAM[^bib-arm-dstream-interface-ref].

The BeagleBoard Rev D and Beagleboard-xM use this connector.

### 20-pin ARM "Standard" Debug Connector Pinout

This is the most common 20-pin debug connector pinout for an ARM device.

<Image src={require('./arm-cortex-20pin-arm-standard-debug-connector-pinout.svg').default} width="500px">Pinout for the 20-pin \"standard\" ARM debug connector[^bib-keil-coresight-conn].</Image>

NOTE: Pin 2 may be specified as either `VCC (optional)` or `NC` (not connected). In most situations I've seen this as `NC`.

### 20-pin Cortex Debug + ETM Connector Pinout

<Image src={require('./arm-cortex-20pin-coresight-debug-connector-pinout.svg').default} width="500px">Pinout for the \"Cortex Debug + ETM Connector\" 20-pin debug connector[^bib-keil-coresight-conn].</Image>

Supported by the ULINKPro.

### 38-pin MICTOR Connector

Connecting a trace probe to a ARM target.
