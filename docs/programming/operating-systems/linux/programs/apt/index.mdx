## Overview

The Linux program `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) is a collection of tools for managing Debian packages.

`apt` is a combination of the most widely used commands from `apt-get` and `apt-cache`. It is the recommended over `apt-get` when used by humans, as it is easier to use and looks better.

`apt` delegates the actual installation and removal of packages to `dpkg`.

## Aborted Package Lists

You may encounter the error "aborted package lists" when trying to run pretty much any `apt` command.

```sh    
$ sudo apt update
...
Aborted package lists... 93%
```

I have been able to fix this by deleting all of the package lists in `/var/lib/apt/lists` with the following command:

```sh    
$ sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
```

Then test if `apt` is working properly by running `sudo apt update` again.
