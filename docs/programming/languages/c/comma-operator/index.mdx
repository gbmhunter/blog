## Overview

The comma operator , is **used to separate expressions**. That means that the comma operator serves the same purpose for expressions as ; does for statements.

The **comma operator has the lowest _precedence_** of any operator in the C programming language.

## What Is It Good For?

Well, not much! Most use cases for the comma operator should never be used, at it severely compromises the readability of the code.

## Perform Operations On Entry To while() Loop

A use of the comma operator that can be sanctioned is when it is used to **perform operations on entry to every iteration of a while() loop**.

For example:

```c
char * rxBuffer;
while(getData(rxBuffer), strlen(rxBuffer) > 0) {
    // Process characters in rxBuffer here
    // ...
}
```

The non-comma operator way would be to do it like this:

```c    
char * rxBuffer;
GetData(rxBuffer);
while(strlen(rxBuffer) > 0) {
    // Process characters in rxBuffer here
    // ...

    GetData(rxBuffer);
}
```

## Prevent Side-Effects In assert() Statements

Another good use is a clever manipulation of the comma operator to **prevent programmers from adding side-effects to their assert statements**. For example, an `assert()` macro defined as:

```c
#define ASSERT(exp)  ((void)(exp), (exp ? : AssertFailed(__FILE__, __LINE__, #exp)))
```

will allow programmers to write `ASSERT(x == 3)` but not `ASSERT(x = 3)`. The comma operator helps achieve this (the comma operator is after the `(void)(exp)` bit). For more information on this, see the [C Assertions page](/programming/languages/c/assertions-assert).
