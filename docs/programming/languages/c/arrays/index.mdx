<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Arrays in C are a form of data structure. They are used to store one or more elements of the same data type. They are all stored in a contiguous block of memory.</p>

<h2>Ragged Array</h2>

<p>A <i>ragged array</i> is a term for an array of pointers which point to objects with a different memory length. One common example is an array of pointers to strings, where each string has a variable number of characters.</p>

<p>A array of pointers to some data type (e.g. an array of pointers to strings) is also a type of <i>Iliffe vector</i>. You have the advantage of being able to use NULL to signify the end of the array (no other data.</p>

<h2>Weird Syntax</h2>

<p>It is a little known and weird fact, but arrays can be written as <code>a[5]</code> or <code>5[a]</code>, it does not matter. However, using the syntax <code>6[a]</code> serves no useful purpose, and confuses people to no-end, so I don't recommend using it!</p>

<h2>Multidimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>A multidimensional array can be created with:</p>

```c
int myArray[3][4];
```

<p>This will create 3 one dimensional arrays, with each having 4 elements (4 integers), for a total of 12 integers. They can be read and written to with the following syntax:</p>

```c
// Read
int x = myArray[0][3]

// Write
myArray[1][2] = 3;
```

<p>The C89 standard requires this memory to be contiguous, just like one-dimensional array.</p>

<h2>Multidimensional Arrays As Function Arguments</h2>

<p>You have to provide all but the left-most dimension of a multidimensional array which is passed into a function as an argument (technically known as a <i>formal parameter</i>). If you think about it, this makes sense, given that C adds no run-time calculations to array operations. For this reason, there is no possible way the compiler can calculate the memory offset (remember, an array is just a contiguous, linear block of memory) for say, <code>myArray[][2]</code> without knowing the sizes of all dimensions except the last.</p>

```c
// Valid 3-dimensional array as the formal parameter
void MyFuction(char[][12][23] myArray);

//! This is invalid!
void MyFuction(char[][][23] myArray);
```

<p>In a sense, <b>when passing an array as an argument to a function, the array always loses one dimension</b>.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Arrays</h2>

<p>Dynamic arrays are arrays whose size is determined at runtime. Programmers use them when we don't know the size of the array in advance (i.e., we can't write a hard-coded integer into the code, but instead we have to use a variable such as x).</p>

<p>Dynamic arrays are not allowed in ANSI C, all arrays have to be static. Infact, even this will give you an error!</p>

```c
const int limit = 100; 
char myArray[limit]; 
                ^^^^^ 
    error: integral constant expression expected 
```

<p>what! <b>Fortunately, C99 has come to the rescue</b>, and allows you to create dynamic arrays on the stack. You can also create dynamic arrays (in all versions of C) on the heap by using the <code>malloc()</code> family of functions.</p>
