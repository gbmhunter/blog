title: Local Jumps (goto)
type: page
---

## Overview

The label operator (`:`) and `goto` statement in C allows you to perform local jumps. A local jump is a jump in code execution within the same function. This is opposed to non-local jumps, which can jump between functions (`setjmp()` and `longjmp()`). The reason jumps are split into two categories is that local jumps are "easier" for the user/compiler to handle, because the stack does not need to be saved/switched.

## C Supports URL's, Wait What?

Did you know that:

```c
http://www.google.com
```

is valid syntax in C? Wait, what? O.K., I was lying, C doesn't support URLs, but the syntax is still valid! What it actually represents is a label (`http:`), followed by a single-line comment (`//www.google.com`).
