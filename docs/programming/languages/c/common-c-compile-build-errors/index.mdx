title: Common C Compile/Build Errors

## Overview

These C compile/build errors and warnings are talked about largely in relation to embedded systems (i.e. microcontrollers).

## "pointer of type void used in arithmetic"

Usually occurs when you are doing memory arithmetic, and can actually be a warning you ignore!

```c    
void* AppendNewArrayElement(void* arrayStart, uint8 currNumElements, uint8 sizeOfArrayElement) {
    // Create a new option at end of option array
    arrayStart = realloc(arrayStart , (currNumElements+1)*sizeOfArrayElement);
    // Set to 0
    memset(arrayStart + currNumElements*sizeOfArrayElement, '\0', sizeOfArrayElement);
}
```

## "elf section '.bss' will not fit in region 'ram'

<Image src={require('./_assets/elf-section-bss-will-not-fit-in-region-ram.png').default} width="700px">C build error 'elf section '.bss' will not fit in region 'ram'</Image>

The .bss section contains all 0-initialized global and static variables. This error normally occurs when you have overly large static variables, or you haven't allocated the stack/heap sizes correctly.

## "Suggested parenthesis around assignment used as a truth value"

This is usually because you've forgotten to add the second `=` in the if statement.

```c   
// Only one equal sign, if statement will produce unexpected results!
// value2 will be assigned to value1 and then
// checked to see if non-zero
if(value1 = value2) {
    // blah blah
}

// Correct way of comparing two values, with two equal signs
if(value1 == value2) {
    // blah blah
}
```

## "Subscripted value is neither array nor pointer"

<Image src={require('./_assets/c-build-error-subscripted-value-is-neither-array-nor-pointer.png').default} width="500px">The C build error 'subscripted value is neither array nor pointer'.</Image>

Normally occurs when you try and index something like an array which isn't. For example...

```c   
#include 

double value;

// This will produce the error, as sin is a function, not an array
value = sin[180];

// The proper way of using sin
value = sin(180);
``` 

## "#pragma once in main file"

<Image src={require('./_assets/c-build-warning-pragma-once-in-main-file.png').default} width="500px">The C compiler warning '#pragma once in main file' which occurs when the directive '#pragma once' is incorrectly placed in a .c file.</Image>

This occurs when you incorrectly write "#pragma once" in a .c file (even though the error would suggest it, it doesn't have to be main.c). "#pragma once" is a header guard which prevents an .h file from being included twice in a project and causing multiple declaration/definition errors. Hence "#pragma once" should be only place in .h files. It is an alternative to the "#ifndef" header guard style (see [this page](/programming/languages/c/header-guards) for more info).

## "variable or field declared void"

<Image src={require('./_assets/c-build-error-variable-or-field-declared-void.png').default} width="500px">The C build error 'Variable or field declared void'.</Image>

This can occur when you declare/define a function in C++ and the compiler doesn't recognise one of the data types used for an input variable. It will precede a `<variable> was not declared in scope` error.

```c   
// A function declaration with an unrecognised type used in the input.
// The will cause both a 'variable or field declared void' and 'inputVar was not declared in scope' error
void function1(unrecognisedType_t inputVar);
``` 

## "macro names must be identifiers"

If you get the error macro names must be identifiers it is usually because you have been using both `#if()` and `#ifdef` directives, and accidentally used the combination `#ifdef()`. This is not allowed! When using `#ifdef`, do not enclose the proceeding identifier with brackets.

```c  
// BAD!
#ifdef(__linux)
    ...
#endif

// GOOD!
#ifdef __linux__
    ...
#endif
```

## "Not In Formal Parameter List"

<Image src={require('./_assets/keil-c51-build-error-not-in-formal-parameter-list.png').default} width="500px">The 'not in formal parameter list' build error is most likely to occur when you have forgotten to add the semi-colon at the end of a function declaration.</Image>

Applies To: Keil C51 Compiler

The "not in formal parameter list" build error is most likely to occur when you have forgotten to add the semi-colon at the end of a function declaration. Without the semi-colon, the compiler continues to read onto the following lines, and usually produces this error. Check the first first function declaration preceding this error for a missing semi-colon.

```c   
// The following function declaration is missing a semi-colon at the end
void function1()
// The "not in formal parameter list" build error will occur on this following line
void function2();
```

## double free or corruption

Error Type: Run Time

This error normally codes with another keyword at the end, e.g.

```c   
double free or corruption (!prev)
```

It normally occurs when you accidentally `free()` the same piece of memory twice. I have also got this error due to a incremental-build bug in the Xilinx SDK (xsdk) for it's Zynq FGPAs/microcontroller chips.
