## Overview

The `auto` specifier (commonly referred to as a keyword) was introduced in C++11. It allows the programmer to tell the compiler to work out the type of the variable, rather than the programmer having to specify it in the code.

```c++    
auto x = 5;
```

The compiler works out what the type of a auto variable should be from it's initializer (the right-hand side the equals sign). For the example above, the compiler determines the type of x as an integer, as this is the default type for an integer value.

## Auto Functions

`auto` can be used as the return type for functions, both for traditional functions and lambdas.

For the above function <code>Foo()</code>, the compiler deduces the return type as <code>int</code>, as this is again the default type for an integer.

```c++
auto Foo() {
    return 4;
}
```

In the below example, the auto return type saves much typing/code mess!

```c++
auto Foo() {
    std::map<std::string, std::vector<uint8_t>> myVar;
    return myVar;
}
```

<h2>decltype</h2>

<p>Although they are similar and often used in the same lines of code, auto should not be confused with <code>decltype</code>. <code>auto</code> operates on types, while <code>decltype</code> operates on expressions.</p>
