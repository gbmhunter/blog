## Overview

Input/output (I/O) is how a program interacts with the computers file system. The C/C++ standard libraries provide methods for reading and writing to files.

Some parts of I/O are standard, others are platform specific.

## cin And cout

`std::cin` and `std::cout` are both of the type . They are declared in `<iostream>`.

File descriptors for `std::cin` and `std::cout` can be found in the header file `<unistd.h>`. They are defined as `STDIN_FILENO` and `STDOUT_FILENO` respectively.

## Input

Input in a C++ program can be grabbed via `std::cin`.

After calling `cin.get()`, I have found it necessary to call `cin.ignore()` to remove the still-present new-line character. If this is not done, `cin.get()` will keep triggering.

## Flushing

The function `fflush()` can be used on an output buffer to write an unwritten data in it's output buffer to the file. The stream remains open after this function call. It returns `0` if the operation was a success.

## select()

`select()` is used to wait on multiple files for input/output at the same time (and returns whenever one of them has data). `select()` is a BSD UNIX function, and therefore not portable to other systems. Ubuntu GCC has this function.

## Non-Blocking IO

By default, reading from `stdin` and writing to `stdout` are blocking operations, that is, they don't return until their job is complete. For input, this is until a character or line had received.

If you desire, you can use non-blocking I/O. I do recommend against it though, and instead suggest you use threads to solve the concurrancy problem (assuming that is why you are wanting non-blocking I/O in the first place). This is because threads and blocking I/O are less computationally intensive, you can run into performance issues when using non-blocking I/O.

There are two common ways of performing non-blocking I/O:

1. Use the ncurses library. The disadvanatage with this is that it also effects the terminal display, and things like printf() stop working correctly.
2. Directly change the low-level file I/O settings. This can be a little confusing at first, but this method does not upset the terminal like ncurses does.

## Using ncurses

## Directly Modifying The Low-Level Settings

This involves using the terminos library. So make sure you `#include <terminos.h>`.

## Detecting Keyboard Presses

The following code can be used to detect keyboard presses, without waiting for a carriage return character.

```c++
int KeyboardPress() {
	struct timeval tv;
	fd_set fds;
	tv.tv_sec = 0;
	tv.tv_usec = 0;
	FD_ZERO(&fds);
	FD_SET(STDIN_FILENO, &fds); //STDIN_FILENO is 0
	select(STDIN_FILENO+1, &fds, NULL, NULL, &tv);
	return FD_ISSET(STDIN_FILENO, &fds);
}
```
