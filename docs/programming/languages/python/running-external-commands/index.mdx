title: Running External Commands
type: page

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Python gives you the ability to run/call external commands from within python scripts. For example, you may wish to call a Linux shell program from within your python code.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>The below example provides a function which can run a sub-process from within Python. It prints output from the sub-process line-by-line to stdout (which is a great feature for seeing the status of the shell program, instead of being dumped with the entire output once the sub-process is finished). The python function returns when the sub-process finishes, returning the sub-processes exit code (normally you would check if it is non-zero, to see if an error occurred).</p>

```python
import subprocess
import shlex


def run_command(command):
    """
    Runs the provided shell command as a sub-process within the current operating system. Prints output from this
    sub-process line-by-line to stdout until the process finishes, at which point this function returns the "return code"
    of the finished sub-process.
    
    :param command:     The shell command you want to run, as a single string (do NOT provide
                        an array of arguments, run_command() will split it for you).
    :return:            The return code of the command, once the process has finished.
    """
    print(command)
    process = subprocess.Popen(shlex.split(command), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    while True:
        output = process.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8')
        if output == '' and process.poll() is not None:
            break
        if output:
            print(output.strip() + '\r')
    rc = process.poll()
    return rc
```

<p>The above code should also preserve text colouring (ANSI escape codes). It has been designed to work with Python 3.</p>

<p><code>shlex</code> is used to split up the string into an array of command-line argument strings, so that the user doesn't have to do this themselves.</p>
