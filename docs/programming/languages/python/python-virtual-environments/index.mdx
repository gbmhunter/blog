## Overview

When writing a Python application, you will likely pull in a number of third party libraries, typically installed by a package manager such as `pip` or `conda`. The application will typically depend on a specific version of each library (or a narrow range of versions). This can cause conflicts if other Python applications on your computer require different versions of the same package.

The solution to this problem is to **create a separate installation space for all of the libraries, specific to the application that uses them**. This is called a _virtual environment_.

Python has a few popular frameworks for creating virtual environments.

## virtualenv 

### Installation

Started at Python 3, virtualenv is installed as `venv` with your Python installation. For Python 2.x users, you can install virtualenv with:

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv # Python 2.x users only
```

`env` will be the name of the virtual environment.

```python
python -m venv env
```

This will create a directory called `env` in your current working directory.

To activate (on UNIX or macOS):

```bash
$ source env/bin/activate
```

To deactivate:

```bash
$ deactivate
```

To save all the libraries to a `requirements.txt` (Linux or Windows `cmd.exe`):

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Be careful if running the above command in PowerShell on Windows! By default, PowerShell will probably not use `UTF-8` encoding but a non-standard `UTF-16 LE`. To prevent this, use the following command instead:

```powershell
pip freeze | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 requirements.txt
```

## pipenv

pipenv is a third-party Python virtual environment framework alternative to the built-in `venv`.

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install --user pipenv
```
