## Overview

Rust is relatively new, statically typed, non garbage collected "systems" programming language. The most unique aspect about Rust compared to similar languages (such as C, C++) is Rusts _ownership model_ (more on this below), which aims to completely eliminate specific memory bugs and race conditions that are common in similar languages.

## Getting Started

### Install Rustup

The easiest way to get started with Rust is to install Rustup, a Rust installer and version management tool.

**On a Linux, macOS or other UNIX-like OS:**

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This will typically provide you with a prompt with options --- accept the defaults to install.

**On Windows:**

Download `rustup-init.exe` [from the Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run the installer.

If you are using the _Windows Subsystem For Linux_ (WSL), you can use the instructions above for UNIX-like OS's.

### Create A New Project With cargo

```sh
cargo new hello-world
```

`cargo` should setup a basic project for you. You can now run the template by doing the following:

```sh
cd hello-world
cargo run
   Compiling AdventOfCode2019 v0.1.0 (/Users/ghunter/code/AdventOfCode2019)
warning: crate `AdventOfCode2019` should have a snake case name
  |
  = note: `#[warn(non_snake_case)]` on by default
  = help: convert the identifier to snake case: `advent_of_code2019`

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.55s
     Running `target/debug/AdventOfCode2019`
Hello, world!
```

## Ownership

**The most unique aspect of the Rust language is it's _ownership model_**. This ownership system combines ownership, borrowing and copying concepts and relies heavily on zero-cost (no run-time influence) compiler checks to implement it. The system is designed to prevent common software issues relating to concurrency and data races.

```rust
fn main() {

}
```

### Lifetimes Of References

Every reference in Rust comes with a _lifetime_, although in many cases Rust will let you omit the lifetime syntax and the references lifetime will be implied by the context. Lifetimes are specified by `'<identifier>`, e.g. `'a` would read the "lifetime of `a`", and `'xyz` the "lifetime of xyz".

```rust
fn my_fn(my_object: MyObject&) { // Implied lifetime (length of function)
  ...
}

struct MyStruct<'a> {
  my_object: MyObject& 'a // Explicit lifetime
}
```

You can read more about the ownership system in the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html).

## Casting

Basic type casting is done is Rust with the `as` operator:

```rust
let x: u32 = 22;
let y: i32 = x as i32;
```

## Printing To stdout

Rust provides you with the `println!()` macro to perform basic printing to `stdout`. It supports a C-like variable length argument syntax with the string as the first parameter, and then successive parameters being the replacement variables. While C uses `%s`,`%u`, e.t.c to denote locations for replacement, Rust uses `{}`:

```rust
println!("My variable = {}", my_var);
```

You do not have to import any module to call `println!()`.

## Source Code

The source code for Rust is maintained on GitHub at [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

## Online Editor

You can write and run Rust test code online at the [Rust playpen](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

## Embedded Platforms

Rust is beginning to be used on embedded platforms (however, it is still in a mostly experimental manner). There is discussion of the suitability of rust for an embedded platform at [Atomic Object](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/02/20/rust-language-c-embedded/).

[zinc.rs](http://zinc.rs/) is an attempt to write an ARM stack (similar to CMSIS or mbed in functionality, which are both written in C) using the rust programming language.

## IDE Support

The [_Rust (rls)_ extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) adds Rust code completion, jump to definition, peek definition, find all references, symbol search, documentation on hover, code formatting, refactoring, error squiggles, snippets, build tasks and more.

## Containers

### HashMap

Known in other languages as a _map_, _dictionary_ (Python).

To add a value use the `insert()` method. The following example adds the value `2` to the key `"mykey"`.

```rust
my_hashmap.insert("mykey", 2);
```

To retrieve a value at a certain key, use the `get()` method:`

```rust
let value = my_hashmap.get("mykey");
if let Some(v) = value {
    println!("Got value of {}", value);
}
```

## Dealing With Unrecoverable Errors

You can cause the current thread to panic with the `panic!()` macro. This will cause the current thread to terminate. If you happen to be on the main application thread, this will cause the application to exit:

```rust
panic!("Something really bad happened!");
```

which will produce output similar to:

```text
thread 'main' panicked at 'Something really bad happened!', src/main.rs:2:5
```
