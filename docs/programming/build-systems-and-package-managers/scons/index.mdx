## Overview

SCons is a build system.

## Installation

**Ubuntu 16.04**

You can install scons with:

```sh
$ sudo apt install scons
```

**However...**

The default scons provided by 16.04 (xenial) is very out-of-date (v2.4.1). You can get the latest scons (v3.0.1) as of Mar 2018) by first adding the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:

```sh    
deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic main universe
```

And then install scons with the command:

```sh    
$ sudo apt install scons
```

## Basic Hello, World Example

**Prerequisites**

* scons is installed on your system

:::note
The console commands assume a UNIX-style terminal, although the example should be easily doable on any OS supported by scons.
:::

**Steps**

1. Create a new folder called "HelloProject". All following files in this example will be created in this folder.
2. Create a file called main.cpp with the following content:  

    ```c
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
    	std::cout << "Hello, world." << std::endl;
    	return 0;
    }
    ```

3. Create a file called sconstruct (no file extension) with the following content:  

    
    env = Environment()
    hello = Program(["hello.cpp"])

4. From the console, run scons in the current folder:  

    ```sh    
    $ scons
    ```

5. This should start the build process and produce an executable called hello. Run the executable with the following command:  

    ```sh    
    $ ./hello
    "Hello, world."
    ```

6. Finished!

## Importing And Exporting

scons variables may be shared between sconscript files through _importing_, _exporting _and _returning_.

Before you can import a variable, it must be exported. You can do this by calling Export() and providing it with a space-separated string of all the variables you wish to export:
  
    Export('env installDir')

You can then import this from a different Sconscript file:
    
    Import('env installDir')

You can return a single object from a Sconscript with the Return() function:
    
    Return('myLib')

The can be captured in the calling Sconscript file with:
    
    myLib = Sconscript('src/mySubSconscript')

## Building

By default, scons does not perform an out-of-source build. You can perform an out-of-source build by including the following line in your root-level sconstruct file:

```
SConscript("src/MyApp.scons", variant_dir="build", duplicate=0)
```

where `src/MyApp.scons` points to a child scons file.
