## Overview

The XMEGA is a family of microcontroller made by ATMEL.

## Programming

The XMEGA family supports JTAG and PDI programming. Supported programmers include the AVR JTAG ICE (for JTAG programming and debugging) and AVRisp MkII (as long as the firmware has been updated to support PDI). There are also 3rd party and homebrew programmers that support XMEGA's.
