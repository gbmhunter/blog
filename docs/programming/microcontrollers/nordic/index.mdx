## Overview

Nordic has a range of microcontroller families. They specialize in low-power Bluetooth MCUs, and their portfolio includes the nRF52, nRF53 and nRF92 range of MCUs (they call them SOCs).

The nRF5 SDK entered maintenance mode around the year 2021-2022[^reddit-embedded-nrf5-sdk-vs-nrf-connect-sdk], with the intention that new FW projects would use the Nordic nRF Connect SDK instead.
