## Overview

The _nRF53 Series_ is a family of SoCs by Nordic Semiconductor. Two of their core features are Bluetooth and low-energy operation.

The nRF53 series expands on the nRF52 series of MCUs by added dual-cores. One core is designed to run the Bluetooth/networking stack, while the other core is designed to run your application's business logic.

The nRF5340-DK (nRF5340 Develop Kit) is the de facto development kit for the nRF53 series.

## Programming

nRF53 MCUs can be programmed with the Nordic _Programmer_ software (part of _Nordic Connect for Desktop_) along with a physical programmer such as a the nRF9160-DK development board.
