You can use the standard C way (note this is assuming a 32-bit register (e.g. PSoC 5 device).

```c
volatile uint32_t * myReg = (volatile uint32_t *)0xE000E304;

// Read
uint32_t regVal = *myReg;

// Write
*myReg = 0x0000FFFF;
```

PSoC also provides macros and typedefs for this process.

## Register Description

Cypress fully describes all of the fixed PSoC 5LP registers [in this PDF](/images/2013/07/psoc-5-lp-registers-description.pdf). Note that this does not include registers that are generated when you add components to the visual editor (e.g. UART and ADC registers).
