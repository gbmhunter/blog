## Overview

This page serves to be a tutorial on the basic types of signals/waveforms you will come across in engineering.

All usages of trigonometric functions such as $\sin()$ and $\cos()$ below assume **angles measured in radians, not degrees**.

This page assumes basic understanding of trigonometry and complex numbers.

## Real Sinusoidal Signals

A real sinusoidal signal has the general form:

$$ f(t) = A \sin ( \omega t + \theta ) $$

<p className="centered">  where:<br/>
  $A$, $\omega$, and $\theta$ are real numbers</p>

An example sinusoidal where $ f(t) = 2\sin(2t + \frac{\pi}{4}) $ is shown below:

:::note
$\sin()$ in the above equation may be replaced by $\cos()$, which just shifts everything by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ ($ \cos(x) = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})  $). It is still called a sinusoidal signal.
:::

$A$ controls the amplitude of the signal. A negative number will invert the signal. A value of $A = 1$ will give an amplitude of $1$. 

$\omega$ controls the period/frequency of the signal. A value of $\omega = 1$ gives a period of $2\pi$. Doubling $\omega$ doubles the frequency.

$\theta$ controls the offset of the signal along the x-axis. A positive value shift the signal to the left, a negative value shifts the signal to the right.

**Sinusoidal signals normally arise in systems that conserve energy**, such as an ideal mass-spring system (no damper or frictional forces!), or an ideal LC circuit (no resistive losses).

Complex sinusoidal signals are introduced after exponential signals are explained.

## Exponential Signals

The general form for an exponential signal is:

$$ f(t) = Ae^{\lambda t} $$

<p className="centered">  where:<br/>
  $A$, $\lambda$ are complex numbers</p>

### Real Exponential Signals

Below are some examples of real exponential signals, showing how varying $A$ and $\lambda$ (limited to real numbers only) effect the waveform shape.

<Image src={require('./examples-of-basic-real-exponential-signals.png').default} width="700px"></Image>

When $\lambda > 1$, the signal exhibits _exponential growth_ (this typically represents an _unstable_ signal). When $\lambda < 1$, the signal exhibits _exponential decay_ (this typically represents a _stable_ signal).

### Complex Exponential Signals

If the restriction that $A$ and $\lambda$ must be real numbers is removed from the general form for an exponential signal, and they are now complex numbers, a different class of signals arise. We substitute $\lambda$ in the general form for a exponential signal for the complex number $z = \sigma + i\omega $ to give:

$$ f(t) = Ae^{(\sigma + i\omega)t} $$

<p className="centered">  where:<br/>
  $\sigma$ is the attenuation constant<br/>
  $\omega$ is the angular frequency</p>

Recap Euler's formula:

$$ e^{it} = \cos(t) + i\sin(t) $$

Also,

$$ A = |A|e^{i\theta} $$

This allows us to separate out the real and imaginary parts into individual terms:

$$
\begin{align}
f(t)  &= Ae^{\lambda t} \\
      &= |A|e^{i\theta}e^{(\sigma + i \omega)t} \\
      &= |A|e^{i\theta}e^{\sigma t + i \omega t} \\
      &= |A|e^{i\theta}e^{\sigma t}e^{i \omega t} \\
      &= |A|e^{\sigma t}e^{i (\omega t + \theta)} \\
      &= |A|e^{\sigma t} \cos(\omega t + \theta) + i |A|e^{\sigma t} \sin(\omega t + \theta)
\end{align}
$$

Below are graphs of the real component of both growing and decaying complex exponential signals. **You can see how the signal is enveloped by $\pm |A|e^{\sigma t}$**. This is because the signal is the product of an exponential component and a $\cos()$ component, and the $\cos()$ component always varies between $-1$ and $1$.

## Heaviside (Unit-Step) Function

The **Heaviside function**, named after [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside) (also known as the **unit-step function**) can be defined as:

$$
f(t) =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for $t < 0$} \\
1 & \text{for $t > 0$}
\end{cases}
$$

The Heaviside function looks something like the signal below, however the point at $H(0)$ can be drawn in different ways (more on that below):

<Image src={require('./the-unit-step-function-heaviside.png').default} width="700px"></Image>

Oliver Heaviside used his equation to calculate the current in an electrical circuit when it is first switched on.

### The Different Conventions For H(0)

The value of Heaviside function at 0 ($H(t)$ at $t = 0$) depends on the implementation or use of the function. The different values are described below. However, it is worth noting that **the value of $H(0)$ is of no importance for most use cases of the Heaviside function**, as it is commonly used as a windowing function in integration (or distribution).

**H(0) = 0**

$$
H(t) =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for $t <= 0$} \\
1 & \text{for $t > 0$}
\end{cases}
$$

This is how the NIST DLMF (_Digital Library of Mathematical Functions_) defines the Heaviside function (see [section 1.16.13](https://dlmf.nist.gov/1.16#E13)). This version of the Heaviside function is left-continuous at $t = 0$ but not right continuous.

<Image src={require('./heaviside-unit-step-function-h0-eq-0.png').default} width="500px"></Image>

**H(0) = 0.5**

If the convention $H(0) = 0.5$ is used, the Heaviside function defined as:

$$
H(t) =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for $t < 0$} \\
\frac{1}{2}, & \text{for $t = 0$} \\
1 & \text{for $t > 0$}
\end{cases}
$$

This is the version of the Heaviside function which seems to be most often used. The [Numpy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.heaviside.html) for `numpy.heaviside()` states that $H(0) = 0.5$ is often used. This format of the Heaviside is also closely related to the [signum function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function) (the function used to extract the sign of a real number), by the following equation (shifted up by 1 and then halved in magnitude):

$$ H(t) = \frac{1 + sgn (t)}{2} $$

Drawn on a graph it looks like:

<Image src={require('./heaviside-unit-step-function-h0-eq-0p5.png').default} width="500px"></Image>

**H(0) = 1**

$$
H(t) =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for $t < 0$} \\
1 & \text{for $t >= 0$}
\end{cases}
$$

$H(0) = 1$ is how ISO 80000-2:2009 defines the Heaviside function. This version of the Heaviside function is right-continuous at $t = 0$ but not left continuous. It also allows the Heaviside function to be defined as the integration of the unit impulse (Dirac delta) function:

$$ H(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} \delta(x) dx $$

Drawn on a graph it looks like:

<Image src={require('./heaviside-unit-step-function-h0-eq-1.png').default} width="500px"></Image>

The Heaviside function is usually defined like this when used in the context of cumulative distributions for statistical purposes. 

**H(0) = [0, 1]**

$H(0) = [0, 1]$ is when the Heaviside equals both $0$ and $1$ (a set) at $t = 0$. This approach is not as common, but is used in optimization and game theory.

### Shifted Heaviside

## Unit Impulse (Dirac Delta) Function

The unit-impulse function (known as a the _Dirac delta function_ in the mathematical world) is defined as:

$$
f(t) = 0 \text{ for } t \neq 0 \text{ and} \\
\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} f(t) dt = 1
$$

The unit-impulse function is $0$ everywhere except for $t = 0$ where it is infinite.
