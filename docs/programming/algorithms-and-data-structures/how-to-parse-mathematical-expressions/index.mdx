## Overview

This aim of this tutorial is to introduce the concept of parsing instructions expressed as text into executable code. This serves as a basis for working with machine readable languages (e.g. compilers, JSON deserialization and mathematical expression evaluators). This page will use examples for evaluating basic mathematical expressions.

## Input Notation

### Infix Notation

As humans, we are used to using _infix notation_ to write mathematic expressions:

```text
y = 5 * (x + 2)
```

Unfortunately, this notation is very hard for a computer to understand and parse.

### Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

Reverse polish notation (RPN) is an alternative notation to _infix notation_. It is also known as _postfix notation_. In RPN notation, the operands always come before the operator, which is always specified last. For example, `2+3`, which is in infix notation, would become `2 3 +`.

The same expression above (`y = 5 * (x + 2)`), but in RPN is:

```text
y = 5 x 2 + 2 ^ *
```

RPN does not require the use of parenthesis to preserve the correct order of operations. RPN can linearize a tree data-structure, which can have memory benefits.

You may have noticed the some older calculators don't work as you're "used to". This could be because they use RPN! The Hewlett-Packard HP-48 graphic calculator presented RPN to the user (no infix notation was allowed!).

## Sequence of Events

Lexer: Converts the grammar (which is the input, i.e. mathematical expression as a string) into a sequence of tokens. Less formally, it can also be called a tokenizer.

Parser: Reads the tokens outputted from the lexer and parses them into a structure such as RPN or AST. It reshapes the tokens into a structure according to rules such as operator preceedance.

Evaluator: Processes the output of the parser, and produces the result the user wants to see. In the case of an AST, the evaluator will typically perform a depth-first evaluation of all the nodes in the AST (which is easily performed with recursion).

## Grammar



Context-free grammars are the most common.

Grammar is a way of formally describing the structure of a language. You can call grammar the _language of languages_. Grammar is usually written as a sequence of _rules_. Each rule has two parts, a _name_, and an _expansion_ of the name. The expansion shows what the name can built from. The idea of rules is to describe the syntax as a hierarchy, starting at the broad structure of the language and then breaking it down into smaller and smaller components. The _name_ can also be called a _non-terminal symbol_. This refers to the fact that it just an intermediary representation and will be expanded into smaller components. Things such as a `number` are called _terminal symbols_.

We will use a simple calculator program as an example. The calculator allows you to type in _expressions_. Each _expression_ is built from two _terms_, which are added together. We will 

```text
expr -> term + term
term -> factor * factor
factor -> number
```

Of course, the basic syntax above is fairly limiting. While our calculator would accept `2*3 + 4*5`, it wouldn't accept `2*3 + 4*5 + 6*7` as it only allows for exactly two terms (and exactly two factors in each term). We also couldn't type `2*3 - 4*5` as it only allows for addition! We need a way of grouping multiple operators together `+` and`-`, and expressing that an expression can be composed of any number of terms added together. We will improve the functionality of our calculator when we look at Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) below.

### Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)

EBNF is a standardized way of writing grammar. All names are enclosed in angled brackets, e.g. `<name>`. Let's write a basic calculator:

```text
<expr>   := number "+" number
```

So far, our calculator only allows an expression in the form `2+3`. Let's add more to this!

The `|` in EBNF represents `OR`, e.g. an `expr` may consist of a `term + term` OR just a `term`.

```text
<expr>   := number "+" number
         |  number
```

Now we can write expressions such as: `3 + 2`, or just `4` (typing just `4` on a calculator seems a little pointless, but we would expect it to work!).

However, we still can't type `1 + 2 + 3`, as the grammar does not allow for more than two numbers. You can use curly braces `{` and `}` to indicate that what's inside can repeated zero or more times. The below example states that our calculator can accept an expression which equal to one term **plus zero or more terms**:

```text
<expr>   := <term> {"+" <term>}
```

Now we can write expressions such as: `1 + 2 + 3` and `4`.

Note that we don't have to specify `| number` anymore, as the case in where the expression is just a single number is handled by zero repetitions of `{"+" <term>}`.

We can use round braces `(` and `)` to group things together. The below example specifies that an expression is composed of any number of terms that are either added OR subtracted from one another:

```text
<expr> := number {( "+" | "-" ) number}
```

Now we can write things such as `1 - 2` and `1 + 2 - 3`.

Lets now expand the calculators functionality so that we can also multiply! 

```text
<expr>   := <term> {("+" | "-") <term>}

<term>   := number {("*" | "/") number}
```

Notice how we added a new rule for multiplication/division. Where everywhere previously we could use a `number` in the addition/subtraction rule, we now have a `<term>`. This further expands to say that `<term>` is composed of any amount of numbers separated by `*` or `/`. Structuring the grammar in this way captures the correct precedence of mathematical operators, **multiplication must occur before addition**.

Now we can write things such as: `1*2 + 3*4` or `1 + 2*4` or `1*2`!

We will now add support for negation symbols in front of numbers. Everything discussed so far has been a binary operator, i.e. it has operated on two numbers. The negation symbol is a unary operator (operates on one number). It is also optional, so we can enclose it in square brackets (`[` and `]`).

```text
<expr>   := <term> {("+" | "-") <term>}

<term>   := <factor> {("*" | "/") <factor>}

<factor> := [ "-" ] number
```

Now we can write expressions such as: `-1*2` or `1*-2` or `-1 + 2`! 


Putting all of this together, the complete grammar for our calculator now becomes:

```text
<expr>   := <term> "+" <term>
         |  <term>

<term>   := <factor> "*" <factor>
         |  <factor>

<factor> := number
```


## A Recursive Decent Parser (RPN)

A _Recursive Descent Parser_ (RPN) is a type of parser which uses function recursion as a primary technique for parsing expressions. One of the main benefits of RPNs is that their design closely matches the structure of EBNF grammar syntax.
