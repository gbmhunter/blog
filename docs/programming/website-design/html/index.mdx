## Comments

Comments within HTML code are added using the following syntax.

```html    
<!-- This is a HTML comment -->
```

## GET, PUT, e.t.c

The common command send when you type a URL into your browser is GET.

You can use the program curl on Linux-systems to send different commands to URLs.

```sh    
$ curl -i -X GET http://my.url
```

Or you can use a web-based app such as the [Simple REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-rest-client/fhjcajmcbmldlhcimfajhfbgofnpcjmb?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon).

## API Design

Apiary ([http://apiary.io/](http://apiary.io/)) is a useful tool for designing web-based APIs (APIs using HTML requests). It allows instant API mock creation with automatic documentation and testing. It is free for single, non-commercial users (aka hackers).

## Dynamic Content

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) is a great tool for dealing with dynamic content. It is a tool that allows things such as data-binding, which allows a UI interface following the MVC or MVVC pattern. It is implemented in purely client-side Javascript. An alternative to AngularJS is [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/).
