## Haversine Formula

The _Haversine_ formula can be used to find the shortest distance (great circle distance) between two points on the earth's surface, given their latitude and longitude coordinates.

$$
d = 2r \cdot arcsin(\sqrt{sin^2(\frac{\varphi_2 - \varphi_1}{2}) + cos(\varphi_1)cos(\varphi_2)sin^2(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2})})
$$

<p className="centered">where:<br/>
$ d $ is the shortest (great circle) distance between the two points, in meters<br/>
$ r $ radius of the earth, in meters *(see below)<br/>
$ \varphi_1, \lambda_1 $ is the latitude and longitude of point 1, in radians<br/>
$ \varphi_2, \lambda_2 $ is the latitude and longitude of point 2, in radians<br/></p>

The typical value used for $ r $ is $ 6731 \times 10^3 m $, which is the mean radius of the earth.

The code for this formula in many different languages can be found at [https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

You may also see this Haversine distance formula written as:

$$ 
a = sin^{2}(\frac{\varphi_2 - \varphi_1}{2}) + cos(\varphi_1) \cdot cos(\varphi_2) \cdot sin^{2}(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}) \\
c = 2 \cdot atan2(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1 - a}) \\
d = r \cdot c 
$$

where all the symbols have the same meaning as above

These two formulas are equivalent!

## Bearing

This formula calculates the initial bearing, given a start and end co-ordinate.

$$
\theta = atan2(sin(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1) \cdot cos \varphi_2 \cdot cos \varphi_1 \cdot sin \varphi_2 - \\
sin \varphi_1 \cdot cos \varphi_2 \cdot cos(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1))
$$

<p class="centered">where:<br/>
$ \theta $ is the initial bearing, in radians, from $ -\pi $ to $ +\pi $<br/>
$ \varphi_1, \lambda_1 $ is the latitude and longitude of point 1, in radians<br/>
$ \varphi_2, \lambda_2 $ is the latitude and longitude of point 2, in radians<br/></p>

Note that this calculates the _initial bearing_, which is the bearing you would have to be pointing in at the first co-ordinate to travel to the second co-ordinate along a great circle (shortest path on the sphere). **As you travel there, the bearing is likely to change** (there are a few cases in where it wouldn't change, one being if you were travelling exactly North).

## Destination Coordinate Given Distance And Bearing From Start Coordinate

The following formula allows you to calculate a destination coordinate (lat/lon) if you know a starting coordinate (again, in lat/lon), ground distance (great circle distance) and initial bearing.

$$
\delta = \frac{d}{R} \\  
p_{2,lat} = \arcsin(\sin p_{1,lat} \cdot \cos \delta + \cos p_{1,lat} \cdot \sin \delta \cdot \cos \theta ) \\  
p_{2,lon} = p_{1,lon} + \arctan2(\sin \theta \cdot sin \delta \cdot \cos p_{1,lat}, \cos \delta - \sin p_{1,lat} \cdot \sin p_{2,lat})
$$

<p class="centered">where:<br/>
$\delta$ = angular distance, in radians<br/>
$d$ = ground (great circle) distance between start coordinate and destination coordinate, in meters<br/>
$R$ = radius of the earth, in meters $ (6871 \times 10^3m) $<br/>
$\theta$ = initial bearing from start to destination coordinate (clockwise from North), measured in radians<br/>
$p_1$ = starting coordinate, latitude and longitude measured in radians<br/>
 $p_2$ = destination coordinate, latitude and longitude measured in radians<br/></p>

Note that $ p_{2,lon} $ depends on $ p_{2,lat} $, so you have to calculate the latitude of p2 before you can calculate the longitude.
