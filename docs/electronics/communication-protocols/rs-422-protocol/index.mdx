## Overview

_RS-422_ (a.k.a. TIA/EIA-422) is a serial, differential communication protocol used for transmitting data. RS-422 uses 2 wires for transmitting and 2 wires for receiving for full-duplex communication. 1 driver and up to 10 receivers can be connected per twisted pair, which is called _simplex multidrop_[^bib-ti-rs-422-rs-485] (unlike RS-485, which is differential and allows for multiple drivers). It is closely related to the less popular RS-423 protocol. It is also related to the [RS-232](/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-232-protocol/) (single-ended) and [RS-485](/electronics/communication-protocols/rs-485-protocol/) (differential) communication protocols.

| Speed  | Max. Distance
|--------|-----------------------
| 10kbps | 1200m[^bib-wp-rs-422]
| 10Mbps | 10m

The maximum allowed differential voltage is \(\pm 6.0V\)[^bib-wp-rs-422].

A _mark_ (binary 1) is transmitted with a negative differential voltage, a _space_ (binary 0) is transmitted with a positive differential voltage. This is the same terminology and "inverse" polarity as RS-232 and RS-485.

## Connectors

The [DE-9](/electronics/components/connectors/d-subminiature-d-sub-connectors/) is the de facto industry standard connector for RS-422.

### DE-9 (DB-9)

The industry standard pinout for RS-422 in a DE-9 connector is shown in the table below[^bib-active-experts-rs422-pinout].

### DB-25

The [D-Subminiature DB-25 connector](/electronics/components/connectors/d-subminiature-d-sub-connectors/) is another popular choice for carrying RS-422 signals.
