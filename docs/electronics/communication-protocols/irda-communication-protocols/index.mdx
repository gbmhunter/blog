## Overview

The _Infrared Data Association_ (IrDA) is a industry-supported group that defines a number of infrared-based optical communication protocols, which are also referred to as "IrDA".

All IrDA protocols are half-duplex (transmission does not occur in both directions at the same time) because a devices receiver is typically "blinded" by it's transmitter when sending data, thus making full-duplex impossible.
