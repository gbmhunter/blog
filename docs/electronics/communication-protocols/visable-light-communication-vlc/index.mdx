## Overview

_Visible light communication_ (VLC) is a family of communication protocols which use visible light (electromagnetic radiation between 400-800THz, or 375-780nm) to transfer information. Light sources such as LEDs are used to send information, and receivers such as photodiodes, phototransistors and arrays of such (eg. cameras) are used as receivers.

## Modulation

* Amplitude Switch Keying (ASK)
* Phase Switch Keying (PSK)
* Frequency Switch Keying (FSK)
* On-Off Keying

## Li-Fi

Li-Fi is a VLC communication protocol which uses the ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectrum to transmit data at high speeds.
