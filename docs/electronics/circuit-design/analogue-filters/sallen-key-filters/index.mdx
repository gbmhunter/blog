## Overview

The Sallen-Key filter is one of the **most popular active 2nd-order analogue filters topologies**[^bib-analog-devices-ch8-analog-filters]. It can be configured as a low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band-stop filter. Also called a _Sallen and Key_ filter. It was first introduced in 1955 by R.P. Sallen and E.L. Key of MIT's Lincoln Labs, whose last names give this filter it's name. It is a _filter topology_, and defines the components and connections between them to realize a 2nd order filter. Various [filter tunings](/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/filter-tunings/) such as Butterworth, Bessel and Chebyshev can be implemented using the Sallen-Key topology.

</div>

The Sallen-Key filter has **low _component spread_** (low ratios of highest to lowest capacitor and resistor values). It also has a high input impedance and low output impedance, allowing for multiple filters to be chained together without intermediary buffers.

The **performance of a Sallen-Key filters does not depend that much on the performance of the op-amp**. This is because the op-amp is used as an amplifier, rather than an integrator, which minimizes the gain-bandwidth requirements of the op-amp[^bib-analog-devices-ch8-analog-filters]. However there are high-frequency limitations to the Sallen-Key filter, which are explained in more detail below.

One disadvantage of the Sallen-Key filter is that the **Q of the filter is very sensitive to component variations**, which can be a problem, especially for high-Q filter sections.

The Sallen-Key filter is closely related to a _voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS)_ filter. Some literature makes the **distinction of a Sallen-Key filter having unity gain, and the VCVS filter including non-unity gain** by connecting a resistor divider from the output to the inverting terminal of the op-amp. However we will consider them one and the same for the purpose of analysis, as the unity-gain version is a special subtype of the generalized variable-gain version.

Another popular alternative to the Sallen-Key topology is the Multiple Feedback (MFB) topology[^bib-ti-active-low-pass-filter-design].

## Low-Pass Sallen-Key Filter

The schematic for a variable-gain low-pass Sallen-Key filter (a.k.a. VCVS filter) is shown below.

<Image src={require('./low-pass-variable-gain-sallen-key-filter-schematic.png').default} width="700">The schematic for a variable-gain low-pass Sallen-Key filter.</Image>

The schematic for the unity-gain low-pass Sallen-Key filter is shown below (which is generally not called a VCVS filter). Note the removal of $R_3$ and $R_4$, the output is instead directly fed into the inverting input of the op-amp, just like when using an op-amp as a buffer. **The filter has unity gain in the pass-band.**

:::warning
Take note of labelling of the resistors and capacitors if reading other material on Sallen-Key filters, there is no one popular convention as the resistor and capacitor orders are switched frequently.
:::

The generalized transfer function for a 2nd-order low-pass filter is[^bib-analog-devices-ch8-analog-filters] [^bib-gary-tuttle-second-order-filters]:

$$
\begin{align}
H(s) &= \frac{K\omega_0^2}{s^2 + \frac{\omega_0}{Q}s + \omega_0^2} \\
\end{align}
$$

<p class="centered">
where:<br/>
$K$ is the gain factor<br/>
$\omega_0$ is the characteristic frequency in radians/s [$rads^{-1}$]<br/>
$Q$ is the quality factor and is dimensionless [$no\ unit$]<br/>
$s = j\omega$<br/>
</p>

:::tip
For any general 2nd-order filter, the characteristic frequency $\omega_0$ is not necessarily equal to the cut-off frequency. Also, $\frac{1}{Q}$ is sometimes written as $\alpha$.
:::

Written in the same form as the general equation above, the transfer function for a 2nd-order low-pass Sallen-Key filter is[^bib-analog-devices-ch8-analog-filters]:

$$
\begin{align}
H(s) &= \frac{\frac{K}{R_1R_2C_1C_2}} {s^2 + \left[(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2})\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1 - K}{R_2C_2} \right]s + \frac{1}{R_1R_2C_1C_2}} \\
\end{align}
$$

Equating the coefficients in the general form ($Eq.\ \ref{eq:gen-2-order-lp}$) with those specific to the Sallen-Key topology ($Eq.\ \ref{eq:sallen-key-2-order-lp}$) allows us to find the equations of the characteristic frequency and quality factor.

The cut-off frequency is (remembering $f = 2\pi \omega$):

$$
\begin{align}
f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{R_1R_2C_1C_2}}
\end{align}
$$

and the quality factor is:

$$
\begin{align}
Q = \frac{\sqrt{R_1R_2C_1C_2}}{R_1C_1 + R_2C_1 + R_1C_2(1 - K)}
\end{align}
$$

The gain equation is the same as for an non-inverting amplifier:

$$
\begin{align}
K = 1 + \frac{R_3}{R_4}
\end{align}
$$

### How To Calculate Component Values

#### Setting Filter Components As Ratios

The idea here is to define a new variable $m$ which is the ratio of the resistances and a new variable $n$ which is a ratio of the capacitances.

So we define:

$$
\begin{align}
R_1 = mR,\ R_2 = R,\ C_1 = C,\ C_2 = nC \\
\end{align}
$$

This simplifies the cut-off frequency and quality factor equations to:

$$
\begin{align}
f_c &= \frac{1}{2\pi RC\sqrt{mn}} \\
Q   &= \frac{\sqrt{mn}}{m + 1 + mn(1 - K)} \\
\end{align}
$$

Firstly, you decide on a desired gain $K$ and quality factor $Q$. Then chose a ratio $n$ for the capacitors, for example $1$. This will allow you to calculate $m$ using the equation for the quality factor.

With arbitrary $K$, $Q$ and $n$, solving the quality factor equation for $m$ gives something truly horrible (I cheated and got [Wolfram Alpha to solve this one](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=solve+Q%3Dsqrt%28m+n%29%2F%28m+%2B+1+%2B+m+n%281+-+K%29%29+for+m) for me):

$$
\begin{align}
m = \frac{2 K n Q^2 \pm \sqrt{n} \sqrt{4 K n Q^2 - 4 n Q^2 + n - 4 Q^2} - 2 n Q^2 + n - 2 Q^2}{2 Q^2 (K^2 n^2 - 2 K n^2 - 2 K n + n^2 + 2 n + 1)}
\end{align}
$$

Lastly, decide on your cut-off frequency $f_c$ and then you can calculate $R$ using the cut-off frequency equation.

$$
\begin{align}
R &= \frac{1}{2\pi f_c C\sqrt{mn}} \\
\end{align}
$$

The process can be simplified even more, by setting $n = 1$. This makes both capacitors equal.

:::example

**Design Example: Low-Pass K=5, Q=1 Sallen-Key Filter Using mn Ratios**

Design goals:

* Cut-off frequency $f_c = 10kHz$
* Gain $K = 5$
* Quality factor $Q= 1$

Let's first calculate the ratios of resistances and capacitances, $m$ and $n$. We get to choose $n$, so let's go with $n = 1$ to simplify things. Substituting values into the quality factor equation gives us:

$$
\begin{align}
1 &= \frac{\sqrt{m}}{-3m + 1} \nonumber \\
\sqrt{m} &= -3m + 1 \nonumber \\
m &= 9m^2 -6m + 1 \nonumber \\
9m^2 -7m + 1 = 0 \nonumber \\
\end{align}
$$

We can use the quadratic equation to find the two solutions for $m$. Only one of them is gives a real number for $m$ since the initial square root forces $m$ to be positive. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
m = 0.189 \nonumber \\
\end{align}
$$

We have the freedom to choose $C$, and because $n = 1$, $C_1 = C_2 = C$. Let's choose $C = 10nF$, and therefore:

$$
\begin{align}
C_1 &= 10nF \nonumber \\
C_2 &= 10nF \nonumber \\
\end{align}
$$

Using the cutoff frequency equation, we can now find $R$:

$$
\begin{align}
R &= \frac{1}{2\pi f_c C\sqrt{mn}} \nonumber \\
  &= \frac{1}{2\pi 10kHz \times 10nF \sqrt{0.189}} \nonumber \\
  &= 3.66k\Omega \nonumber \\
\end{align}
$$

Choosing the closest E96 value for $R_2$, and calculating $R_1$:

$$
\begin{align}
R_2 &= R \nonumber \\
   &= 3.65k\Omega\ (E96) \nonumber \\
R_1 &= mR \nonumber \\
   &= 0.189 \times 3.66k\Omega \nonumber \\
   &= 692\Omega \nonumber \\
   &= 698\Omega\ (E96) \nonumber \\
\end{align}
$$

Lastly, we can calculate the values of the gain resistors. Choose a value for $R_4=1k\Omega$. Then using the gain equation we can find $R_3$:

$$
\begin{align}
K &= 1 + \frac{R_3}{R_4} \nonumber \\
R_3 &= (K - 1)R_4 \nonumber \\
    &= (5 - 1) \times 1k\Omega \nonumber \\
    &= 4k\Omega \nonumber \\
    &= 4.02k\Omega\ (E96) \nonumber \\
\end{align}
$$

All done! Our finished schematic looks like this:

We chose a $Q$ above 0.707, so we expect some peaking in the gain response around cut-off.

### Tuning Based Design

You can design a Sallen-Key filter based of a particular filter tuning and it's coefficients, this is an alternative to choosing the quality factor and gain yourself. Given the filter tuning coefficients $a_0$ and $a_1$ and desired cut-off frequency $f_c$ you can then calculate the required resistances and capacitances.

The resistance of the resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are related to the capacitances and filter coefficients by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
R_1, R_2 = \frac{a_1 C_1 \mp \sqrt{ (a_1 C_1)^2 - 4 b_1 C_1C_2}}{4\pi f_c C_1 C_2}
\end{align}
$$

You use the $-$ sign when calculating $R_1$ and the $+$ sign for calculating $R_2$.

To obtain real values under the square root, $C_1$ must obey the follow condition:

$$
\begin{align}
C_1 \geq C_2 \frac{4b_1}{a_1^2}
\end{align}
$$

:::note
The choice of resistances affects the cut-off frequency, but the choice of capacitors does not.
:::

These equations give you enough info to calculate all the resistances and capacitors for a Sallen-Key filter. See the design example below to show how you would go about it.

:::example

**Design Example: 2nd-Order Low-Pass Unity-Gain 3dB-Chebyshev Sallen-Key Filter**

The task is to design a 2nd-order unity-gain Sallen-Key filter optimized with Chebyshev 3dB ripple coefficients (this will give us a sharp transition from the passband to the stopband) and a corner frequency of $f_c = 1kHz$.

1. Look up the [Chebyshev filter coefficients](/docs/electronics/circuit-design/analogue-filters/filter-tunings/index.mdx#chebyshev-tunings). From the table we get:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    a_1 = 1.0650 \\
    b_1 = 1.9305 \\
    \end{align}
    $$

1. Choose a capacitance for $C_2$. This is rather arbitrary, but a good recommended starting range is something between $1-100nF$. Lets pick:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    C_2 = 10nF
    \end{align}
    $$

1. Calculate the capacitance of $C_1$:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    C_1 &\geq C_2 \frac{4b_1}{a_1^2} \\
        &\geq 10nF \frac{4\cdot1.9305}{1.0650^2} \\
        &\geq 68.1nF
    \end{align}
    $$

    Pick the next largest E12 value:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    C_1 = 82nF
    \end{align}
    $$

1. Calculate $R_1$ and $R_2$:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    R_1 &= \frac{a_1 C_1 - \sqrt{(a_1 C_1)^2 - 4 b_1 C_1C_2}}{4\pi f_c C_1 C_2} \\
        &= \frac{1.0650 \cdot 82nF - \sqrt{1.0650^2 \cdot 82nF^2 - 4 \cdot 1.9305 \cdot 10nF \cdot 82nF}}{4\pi \cdot 1kHz \cdot 10nF \cdot 82nF} \\
        &= 4.98k\Omega
    \end{align}
    $$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    R_2 &= \frac{a_1 C_2 + \sqrt{a_1^2 C_2^2 - 4 b_1 C_1C_2}}{4\pi f_c C_1 C_2} \\
        &= \frac{1.0650 \cdot 82nF + \sqrt{1.0650^2 \cdot 82nF^2 - 4 \cdot 1.9305 \cdot 10nF \cdot 82nF}}{4\pi \cdot 1kHz \cdot 10nF \cdot 82nF} \\
        &= 12.0k\Omega
    \end{align}
    $$

    Pick the closest E96 values:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    R_1 = 4.99k\Omega \\
    R_2 = 12.1k\Omega
    \end{align}
    $$

1. Build the circuit! It should look like this:

### Frequency Limitations of the Low-Pass Sallen-Key Filter

A low-pass Sallen-Key filter is strongly dependent on the op-amp having a low output impedance. A op-amp's output impedance increases with increasing frequency, thus the performance of the Sallen-Key low-pass begins to suffer at high frequencies. This typically manifests itself with **the -40dB/decade gain turning around and beginning to increase again after a certain frequency in the stop band of the filter**.

This phenomenon can be best understood by analyzing the behaviour at high frequencies. At frequencies much higher than the cut-off frequency $f_c$, we can treat the capacitors as shorts. This gives rise to the equivalent circuit shown below. Shorting $C_2$ means that the op-amps non-inverting input is kept at ground (for high frequency signals), and so nothing should pass from input to output. This is true as long as the op-amp has strong enough "drive" to keep this basic tenant true. Unfortunately, as frequency increases, so does the op-amps output impedance. This impedance effects the op-amps ability to keep the output at $0V$, and the gain begins to rise again.

<Image src={require('./low-pass-variable-gain-sallen-key-filter-freq-limit.png').default} width="900">Equivalent circuit for a low-pass Sallen-Key filter at high frequencies. The left-hand shows the circuit with the capacitors shorted. The right-hand is a simplification showing the addition of the op-amps output impedance.</Image>

Based of the above schematic, we can use the voltage divider rule to write out the transfer function as:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} &= \frac{R_2 || Z_O}{R_1 + R_2 || Z_O} \nonumber \\
                       &= \frac{1}{\frac{R_1}{R_2 || Z_O} + 1} \nonumber \\
                       &= \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{R_1}{\frac{R_2Z_O}{R_2 + Z_O}} + 1} \nonumber \\
                       &= \dfrac{1}{\frac{R_1(R_2 + Z_O)}{R_2Z_O} + 1} \nonumber \\
                       &= \dfrac{1}{\frac{R_1R_2 + R_1Z_O}{R_2Z_O} + 1} \nonumber \\
                       &= \dfrac{1}{\frac{R_1}{Z_O} + \frac{R_1}{R_2} + 1} \\
\end{align}
$$

Assuming $Z_O$ is much smaller that $R_1$, and that $R_1$ and $R_2$ are roughly in the same order of magnitude, **the $\frac{R_1}{Z_O}$ term then dominates the bottom of the fraction**. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} &\approx \frac{Z_O}{R_1} \\
\end{align}
$$

$Z_O$ is the closed-loop impedance. It is frequency-dependent, and is related to the open-loop impedance by: 

$$
\begin{align}
Z_O = \frac{z_O}{1 + AB} \\
\end{align}
$$

<p class="centered">
where:<br/>
$z_O$ is the open-loop impedance<br/>
$A$ is the closed-loop gain<br/>
$B$ is the feedback factor, and equal to $\frac{R_4}{R_3 + R_4}$<br/>
</p>

So as the closed-loop gain $A$ of the op-amp begins to drop at high frequencies, the output impedance of the op-amp begins to increase. **The op-amp then struggles to keep the inverting input of the low-pass Sallen-Key filter at virtual ground**, and begins to let through some of the signal. This reduces the effectiveness of the low-pass filter in the stop band.

We can see the effect of an increasing output impedance at high frequencies in the following bode plot for a 2nd-order low-pass Sallen-Key filter, with a cutoff frequency $f_c$ of 1kHz:

<Image src={require('./low-pass-sallen-key-showing-gain-rise/annotated-plot.svg').default} width="600">Gain plot of a low-pass Sallen-Key filter showing the reversal to increasing again once a certain frequency is reached, owing to the increasing op-amp output impedance.</Image>

## High-Pass Sallen-Key Filter

You can arrive at a high-pass Sallen-Key filter by switching the positions of the resistors and capacitors in a low-pass Sallen-Key filter (just like you can for passive RC filters). This gives you the following schematic:

<Image src={require('./high-pass-variable-gain-sallen-key-filter-schematic.png').default} width="600">Schematic of a variable-gain high-pass Sallen-Key filter.</Image>

The general form of the transfer function for a second order high-pass filter is[^bib-analog-devices-ch8-analog-filters]:

$$
\begin{align}
H(s) = \frac{Ks^2}{s^2 + \alpha \omega_0 s + \omega_0^2} \\
\end{align}
$$

Using Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current/voltage laws, we can write the equivalent transfer function for a variable-gain high-pass Sallen-Key filter, in terms of the resistances and capacitances[^bib-analog-devices-ch8-analog-filters]:

$$
\begin{align}
H(s) &= \frac{Ks^2}{s^2 + \left( \dfrac{\frac{C_2}{R_2} + \frac{C_1}{R_2} + (1-K)\frac{C_2}{R_1}}{C_1C_2} \right)s + \dfrac{1}{R_1C_1R_2C_2}} \\
\end{align}
$$

If you are using the unity-gain op-amp (no $R_3$ or $R_4$), the transfer function simplifies to[^bib-ti-2nd-order-sallen-key-high-pass]:

$$
\begin{align}
H(s) &= \frac{s^2}{s^2 + \left(\dfrac{1}{R_2C_1} + \dfrac{1}{R_2C_2}\right)s + \dfrac{1}{R_1C_1R_2C_2}} \\
\end{align}
$$

This unity-gain transfer function is similar to the unity-gain transfer function for the low-pass filter, except note:
1. It's just $s^2$ on the numerator.
2. The coefficient for $s$ on the denominator changes from $\left(\frac{1}{R_1C_1} + \frac{1}{R_2C_2}\right)$ to $\left(\frac{1}{R_2C_1} + \frac{1}{R_2C_2}\right)$.

This means our unity-gain filter coefficients $a_0$ and $a_1$ are:

$$
\begin{align}
a_0 &= \frac{1}{R_1 \times R_2 \times C_1 \times C_2} \\
a_1 &= \frac{1}{R_2 \times C_1} + \frac{1}{R_2 \times C_2} \\
\end{align}
$$

### How To Calculate Component Values

This design process assumes the following inputs:

* Cut-off frequency $f_c$
* Quality factor $Q$
* Gain $K$

This process is based of [Basic Linear Design: Chapter 8 - Page 8.90](https://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Basic-Linear-Design/Chapter8.pdf).

Choose $C_1$. Set $C_2$ to the same value.

Then calculate an intermediary variable $k$, with:

$$
\begin{align}
k = 2\pi f_c C_1 \\
\end{align}
$$

:::warning
Make sure not to confuse this intermediary variable $k$ with the gain $K$.
:::

Find $\alpha$, which by definition is the inverse of the quality factor:

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha = \frac{1}{Q} \\
\end{align}
$$

$R_1$ and $R_2$ are then:

$$
\begin{align}
R_1 &= \frac{\alpha + \sqrt{\alpha^2 + (K - 1)}}{4k} \\
R_2 &= \frac{4}{\alpha + \sqrt{\alpha^2 + (K - 1)}} \times \frac{1}{k} \\
\end{align}
$$

:::example

**Design Example: High-Pass Sallen-Key Filter With fc=2kHz, Q=0.8, K=4**

Inputs:

* Cut-off frequency of $f_c = 2kHz$
* Quality factor of $Q = 0.8$
* Pass-band gain of $K=4$

1. Firstly, choose the two capacitances to be equal and within a sensible range. $C_1 = C_2 = 10nF$.

1. Calculate the intermediary $k$ variable:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    k &= 2\pi f_c C_1 \nonumber \\
      &= 2\pi \times 2kHz \times 10nF \nonumber \\
      &= 1.26\times 10^{-4} \nonumber \\
    \end{align}
    $$

1. Calculate $\alpha$:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    \alpha &= \frac{1}{Q} \nonumber \\
           &= \frac{1}{0.8} \nonumber \\
           &= 1.25 \nonumber \\
    \end{align}
    $$

1. Calculate $R_1$ and $R_2$:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    R_1 &= \frac{\alpha + \sqrt{\alpha^2 + (K - 1)}}{4k} \nonumber \\
        &= \frac{1.25 + \sqrt{1.25^2 + (4 - 1)}}{4\times 1.26\times 10^{-4}} \nonumber \\
        &= 6.74k\Omega \nonumber \\
        &= 6.81k\Omega\ (E96) \nonumber \\
    R_2 &= \frac{4}{\alpha + \sqrt{\alpha^2 + (K - 1)}} \times \frac{1}{k} \nonumber \\
        &= \frac{4}{1.25 + \sqrt{1.25^2 + (4 - 1)}} \times \frac{1}{1.26\times 10^{-4}} \nonumber \\
        &= 9.40k\Omega \nonumber \\
        &= 9.31k\Omega\ (E96) \nonumber \\
    \end{align}
    $$

1. Choose $R_4 = 1k\Omega$. Then calculate $R_3$:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    R_3 &= R_4 (K - 1) \nonumber \\
        &= 1k\Omega (4 - 1) \nonumber \\
        &= 3k\Omega \nonumber \\
        &= 3.01k\Omega\ (E96) \nonumber \\

### Frequency Limitations of the High-Pass Sallen-Key Filter

The high-pass Sallen-Key filter works well up to a certain frequency, and after which the non-idealities of the op-amp begin to reduce the gain. This turns the high-pass Sallen-Key filter more into a band-pass filter, with the upper frequency cut-off determined by the open-loop gain of the op-amp.

At frequencies much higher than the cut-off $f_c$, we can assume the two capacitors are shorts. This gives us the following schematic:

:::note
Recognize this schematic? It's essentially a basic [non-inverting amplifier](/docs/electronics/components/op-amps/index.mdx#non-inverting-amplifiers)! You can somewhat ignore $R_1$ and $R_2$ as they don't change the basic behaviour of the circuit.
:::

If we assume a non-infinite open-loop gain $A$ of the op-amp, the transfer function of this above circuit is:

$$
\begin{align}
H(f) &= \frac{A}{AB + 1} \\
\end{align}
$$

where $B$ is the feedback factor (how much of the output is fed back to the inverting terminal via the voltage divider made from $R_3$ and $R_4$):

$$
\begin{align}
B &= \frac{R_4}{R_3 + R_4} \\
\end{align}
$$

If we divide the numerator and denominator of $Eq.\ \ref{eq:transfer-fn-high-pass-freq-limit}$ by $AB$ the behaviour of the transfer function as $A$ drops becomes more apparent: 

$$
\begin{align}
H(f) &= \frac{1}{B} \left[\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{AB}}\right] \\
\end{align}
$$

When the open-loop gain $A$ is large, this equation just becomes $H(f) = \frac{1}{B}$, the standard gain equation for a non-inverting op-amp. However, as $A$ decreases we can no longer ignore the $\frac{1}{AB}$ term and it starts reducing the overall gain of the circuit.

You can a practical example of this frequency limitation with the high-pass Sallen-Key filter we designed above. As shown below, the gain of the high-pass filter starts falling and hits $0dB$ at the stated gain bandwidth product $GBW$ at $10MHz$.

## Calculators

The [OKAWA Electric Design website](http://sim.okawa-denshi.jp/en/Fkeisan.htm) has some good Sallen-Key filter calculators, including 2nd and 3rd-order low-pass and high-pass calculators.

The Texas Instruments [Filter Design Tool](https://webench.ti.com/filter-design-tool/filter-type) is a web-based tool that supports the Sallen-Key topology. You firstly enter in the desired characteristics of your filter (e.g. low-pass, cut-off frequency, amount of rejection in stop band, tuning, e.t.c) and then can select Sallen-Key as a topology to implement the filter with.
