## Overview

The _Wheatstone bridge_ (a.k.a. _resistance bridge_) is a circuit consisting of four resistive components. It has the benefit of being able to perform accurate measurements of resistance. The below image shows the basic schematic:

Below is the general equation for the Wheatstone bridge:

$$
\begin{align}
V_{OUT} = V_{DC} \left( \frac{R2}{R1 + R2} - \frac{R4}{R3 + R4} \right)
\end{align}
$$

The output voltage (and consequentially, output current) is 0 when both of the "legs" of the bridge are balanced. That is:

$$
\begin{align}
V_{OUT} = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad \frac{R2}{R1} = \frac{R4}{R3}
\end{align}
$$

The traditional use is to replace the bottom resistors on both legs of the Wheatstone bridge -- one leg with a variable resistor (rheostat or potentiometer) and the other with an unknown resistance which you want to measure. The variable resistor is adjusted until the output voltage (or current) is $0$. Assuming you know the resistance of the rheostat, you can calculate the resistance of $R_x$.

<Image src={require('./_assets/pot-and-unknown-resistance-wheatstone-bridge.png').default} width="400">Traditional use of the Wheatstone bridge. The bottom resistor on one leg is replaced with a rheostat ($R2$), and the other bottom resistor with the unknown resistance $R_x$. Adjusting the rheostat until the output voltage (or current) is 0 "balances" the bridge, and the unknown resistance can be found knowing the other three.</Image>

In the scenario shown above, the unknown resistance $R_x$ can be found with:

$$
\begin{align}
R_x = \frac{R2\ R3}{R1}
\end{align}
$$

## Benefits Over A Simple Resistor Divider

You might be wondering why use a complicated 4-resistor Wheatstone bridge when you could just use a simple 2-resistor [resistor divider](/docs/electronics/components/resistors/index.mdx#resistor-dividers), and measure the output voltage. By knowing the output voltage, the supply voltage, and at least one of the resistances, you can then calculate the other resistance in a resistor divider. **The benefit of a Wheatstone bridge is that it is inherently a _differential_ measurement**, rather than a _single-ended_ one (which a resistor divider is). This means:

* You don't need a precise auxiliary voltage reference to compare with $V_{OUT}$ if you just plan on balancing the bridge (i.e. making $V_{OUT} = 0V$). Because it is _ratiometric_, in this case the supply voltage $V_{DC}$ to the bridge is also unimportant.
* Even if you are measuring the output voltage (and hence need an auxiliary voltage reference):
** Environmental effects that effect both legs of the bridge cancel each other out (e.g. temperature-related drift in the resistances)
** The common-mode voltage that a single-ended resistor divider gives you has been removed, hence it is much easier to apply a large gain to a differential Wheatstone output to measure small voltages.

## History

The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833, but got it's name from Sir Charles Wheatstone, who improved and popularized the circuit in 1843[^bib-maglab-wheatstone-history].

## Applications

* **Strain gauge measurement:** Metal foil strain gauges change their resistance depending on the strain they are subject to. Measuring the small change in resistance precisely is normally done with a Wheatstone bridge circuit. In this application the bridge is not balanced, but rather the output voltage is then fed into an amplifier and then measured (usually with an [ADC](/electronics/components/analogue-to-digital-converters-adcs/)).
* **Weight-scales:** This is typically done with four load cells (each being a strain gauge), where the four load cells are arranged into a Wheatstone bridge topology.
* **Temperature measurement:** One way of measuring temperature is with a thermistor, a component which changes resistance with temperature.
