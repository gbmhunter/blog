## Thermal Resistance

Thermal resistance is way of modelling the thermal behaviour of an object in a way analogous to calculating the current through a resistor by measuring it's voltage.

The equation is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
P_D = \frac{\Delta T}{\sum R_\theta}
\end{align}
$$

<p className="centered">	where:<br/>
	$ P_D $ = Power dissipated by device ($ W $)<br/>
	$ \Delta T $ = Change in temperature between both end-points<br/>
	$ \sum R_{\theta} $ = The sum of thermal resistances over which $ \Delta T $ exists<br/></p>

Which is usually expanded (and used) as:

$$
\begin{align}
P_D = \frac{T_J - T_A}{R_{JC} + R_{CA}}
\end{align}
$$

If there is a heatsink involved, a new term is added:

$$
\begin{align}
P_D = \frac{T_J - T_A}{R_{JC} + R_{CH} + R_{HA}}
\end{align}
$$

## Inaccuracies In The Thermal Resistance Model

* Thermal resistances assume a linear relationship between temperature and heat flow. This is only a first-order approximation.

## List Of Component Package Thermal Resistances

See the [Component Packages page](/pcb-design/component-packages/). This has many of the common component packages and their thermal resistances.

Below is a condensed list of experimentally found internal thermal resistances (junction-to-case).
