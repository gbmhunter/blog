## Overview

_Schottky diodes_ (a.k.a. _Schottky barrier diode_ or _hot-carrier diode_) are diodes formed from a semiconductor-metal junction, rather than a semiconductor-semiconductor junction of a traditional diode. This creates a lower forward voltage drop than standard diodes (typically 0.3V instead of 0.7V), and consequentially also faster switching speeds. They are used in applications where:

* The input voltage is small.
* In high power applications in where the power consumption of the diode needs to be kept to a minimum (e.g. in a [SMPS](/electronics/components/power-regulators/switch-mode-power-supplies-smps/)).
* High switching speed applications.

## How They Are Made

Unlike general purpose diodes which are formed from the junction of N-doped and P-doped semiconductors, **Schottky diodes are formed from the junction of a semiconductor with a metal**[^bib-wikipedia-schottky]. This semiconductor-metal junction is called a Schottky barrier, named after German physicist Walter H. Schottky.

## Schematic Symbol And Designator

## Popular Schottky Diode Part Numbers

### BAT42/BAT43

The BAT42 and BAT43 are popular Schottky diodes, traditionally provided in the [axial DO-35 package](/pcb-design/component-packages/do-35-component-package/). Manufactured by Vishay and STMicroelectronics (among others). The main (and potentially only?) difference between the BAT42 and BAT43 seems to be that the forward voltage for the BAT42 is measured at 10 and 50mA, whilst for the BAT43 it is measured at 2 and 15mA.

### 1N58xx Family

The 1N58xx family of Schottky diodes are typically provided in the [DO-41 package](/pcb-design/component-packages/do-41-component-package/). Part numbers increment from `1N5817` (20V, 1A) through to `1N5825` (40V, 5A).

`1N58xx` Schottky diode part number breakdown:

```text

Voltage/Current Rating
17-19=1A,20-22=3A,23-25=5A
```

## Guard Rings

_Guard rings_ can be designed onto the silicon that makes up a Schottky diode to improve it's robustness to over-voltage, by causing the diode to be driven into avalanche breakdown before the Schottky is damaged by excessive current[^bib-microsemi-intro-to-schottky].

One example of a Schottky diode with a guard ring is the Nexperia PMEG2020AEA 20V, 2A Schottky diode in a SOD-323 package:
