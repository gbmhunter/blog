### Schematic Symbol

A commonly used schematic symbol for an optical isolator is shown below:

Many opto-isolators use a infrared emitting diode optically coupled to a photo transistor, all within a single enclosed component.

AC capable opto-couplers usually have two LEDs in anti-parallel (e.g. the HCPL-354 by Avago).

### The Current-Transfer Ratio

The _current-transfer ratio_ (CTR) of a photo-transistor based optical isolator tells you how well it amplifies an input signal to an output signal. It is the ratio of the collector current $I_C$ at the output side relative to the forward current $I_f$ going through the LED on the input side, and then expressed as a percentage:

$$
\begin{align}
CTR = \frac{I_C}{I_f} \times 100%
\end{align}
$$

For optical isolators with a single phototransistor driver, the current-transfer ratio is normally in the 20-400% range. Sometimes within a family there are multitude of parts with different transfer ratios, specified by slightly different part numbers. The EL3H7-G series from Everlight is one such example.

The current transfer ratio is specified at a particular forward current $I_f$ through the diode and particular voltage across the output collector-emitter $V_{CE}$.

## Phototriac Output Optocouplers

_Phototriac output optocouplers_ (a.k.a. _triac couplers_) are like phototransistor optocouplers, except they have a traic instead of a transistor on the output. The triac's gate is controlled by the incoming light source. Phototriac optocouplers are used to switch on and off an AC load in an isolated manner.

The outputs of phototriac optical isolators usually go on to drive power TRIACs which switch a mains powered load.

## Component Packages

To achieve good isolation, different-net pins must be kept well away from each other to prevent arcing. This prevents many small-pitch packages from being used for optical isolators.

The two most common packages used for optical isolation components are the through-hole [DIP package](/pcb-design/component-packages/dip-component-package) and the surface-mount [SOIC package](/pcb-design/component-packages/soic-component-package).
