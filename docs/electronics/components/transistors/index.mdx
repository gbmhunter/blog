## Overview

Transistors are 3 legged active semiconductor devices. Check out the [Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) page](/electronics/components/transistors/bipolar-junction-transistors-bjts/) if you are after the classic transistor which is **current controlled** and has a base, collector and emitter. Check out the [Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transformer (MOSFET) page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/) if you want to learn more about the more modern transistor which is ubiquitous with CMOS technology which is used in almost all ICs and CPUs today. MOSFETs are **voltage controlled** and have a gate, source and drain.

For more exotic transistors, you might be interested in the [junction-gate field-effect transistor_ (JFET)](/electronics/components/transistors/junction-gate-field-effect-transistor-jfets/) which is like a MOSFET but has a gate current, and is used for things such as low-noise op-amps and simple current sources.

[Silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs)](/electronics/components/transistors/silicon-controlled-rectifiers-scrs/) are a form of thyristor which can switch large currents and latch on until the current reduces to zero.

## Transistor Part Number Standards

If you are lucky enough, the transistors you have will follow a naming standard. This allows you two identify (or partially identify) a transistor from bits of it's part number.
