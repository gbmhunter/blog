## Overview

Magnetometers are miniature electro-mechanical devices that measure the **magnetic field** they are placed in.

## Interference

## Soft-Iron

Soft-iron materials are ones which are not magnetic themselves, but generate a magnetic field.

This includes:

* Ferrous EMI shielding
* Screws
* Battery contacts

## Hard-Iron

Hard-iron materials are ones which are naturally magnetic.

This includes:

* Speakers
* Proximity switches
* Hall-effect sensors

## Electromagnetic

Magnetometers are not directly affected by electromagnetic waves. However, if these waves pass through conductive substances (including those inside the magnetometer itself), these can induce a current which in turn creates a magnetic field.
