## Overview

This page is about electrical devices that glow due to _**electroluminescence**_. For other electrical components that emit light, check out the [IR Devices page,](/electronics/components/ir-devices) the [LED page](/docs/electronics/components/diodes/light-emitting-diodes-leds/index.mdx), [LCD Screen page](/electronics/components/lcd-screens), or the [OLED page](/electronics/components/oled-screens).

The principle way electroluminescence is created in current electronics is by applying an AC waveform across a thin layer of **phosphor**. This can be treated as a capacitor, with the phosphor being the dielectric. The phosphor glows as a small amount of  current passes through it.

## EL Wire

Electroluminescent wire is a thin copper wire, coated in phosphor, then again wrapped with another copper wire, and glows when a medium-voltage AC waveform is applied across the two conductive materials. The AC waveform is normally between 100-240V, and the frequency between 100-1000Hz.

## EL Panels

EL panels are similar to EL wire, except they are made into big, flexible sheets.
