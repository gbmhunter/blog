<td >Return loss</td>
<td >Return loss is the loss of signal power due to a reflection caused by a discontinuity in a transmission line. It is usually expressed as a ratio in dB. A higher return loss is better and a lower one, and results in a lower insertion loss (note that negative return losses should really be expressed as a positive number. Return loss should be expressed as a positive number, but conventionally is expressed as a negative one.</td>

<h2>Antenna Basics</h2>

<h3>Gain</h3>

<p>Because GPS signals transmitted by the satellites have extremely low power once they reach the receiving device, the gain of a GPS antenna is very important!</p>

<h3>Passive vs. Active</h3>

<p>Passive antennas require no power supply, and are cheaper and simpler to use. However, they don't work well when the antenna trace length if long. This is a where a powered active antenna with an on-board LNA is better, since it amplifies the signal at the source, before passing it along the antenna trace to the decoder.</p>

<h3>Polarization</h3>

<p>GNSS signals are right-hand circularly polarized. Thus it makes sense to get a right-hand polarized antenna also.</p>

<h3>VSWR</h3>

<p>For a GPS antenna, the VSWR approaches 1 for the GPS signal frequency. The below graph shows the typical VSWR and efficiency vs. frequency for a passive SMD GPS antenna.</p>

Chip antennas are SMD components which look similar to chip resistors or chip capacitors. Chip antennas come in two types; **on ground types**, that require a **ground below them and a clearance around them**, and **ground-cleared** types, that require a **ground-free area** underneath them. Ground-cleared types have the useful ability of being able to be **reverse mounted** onto PCBs. Examples of GNSS chip antenna manufacturers include [Pulse Electronics](http://www.pulseelectronics.com/products/antennas), Antenova, Taiyo Yuden (who also manufacture chip resistors and capacitors), Johanson Technology, and Ethertronics.

Below is a typical footprint for a 0603-sized chip antenna. Notice how both the input and ground connect up to the same pad of the chip! (and the other pad is connected to ground only). Although you may think this is a direct short, at microwave frequencies you can do this.

## Helixes

Helixes are one of the best types of GNSS antennas because their large volume ensures good reception towards the horizon. Because of their size and cost, they are normally used on large, expensive equipment.

## Patch

Patch antennas are common on circuit boards (PCBs), and also for plug in antennas to smallish GNSS devices.

They are normally made from a base ceramic material (and called ceramic patch antennas). They are typically more expensive than chip antennas but cheaper than helical antennas.

## Relativity

GNSS satellites have to account for relativity, otherwise devices uses these satellites would be inaccurate to about 7m.

## Communications With Microcontroller

GPS modules typically output NMEA protocol data, plus the option for a proprietary protocol that usually contains more information or allows extra features.
